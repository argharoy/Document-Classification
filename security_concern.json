They returned to the car and realised that they forgot their cellphone in the bank. His son Govind went into the bank to collect the cellphone as Raju stayed back in the car. Meanwhile, some persons approached the car and told Raju that he had dropped some currency notes on the ground. Raju peeped out to check the fallen notes. The accused stole the cash, even before he could realise what was happening, and fled. Gajuwaka Police are investigating the case.   OPEN",

        "content": " The ongoing teachers strike in Chhattisgarh is snowballing into a major concern for the Chhattisgarh government as well as the local intelligence. While the teachers are refusing to go back to work till their basic demands are met, the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) has supported the strike. The strike, already in its second week, is growing by the day and the agitators are using newer methods, such as tonsuring each others heads, to embarrass the government while the Assembly is debating their demands. The government, however, categorically refused to meet the teachers demands. The teachers, employed after 1998, are agitating for more than a week across the State. Their primary demands are employment under the Education and Tribal Departments, rather than under the panchayat, and a substantial hike in salary. These teachers are appointed by the gram panchayat or the Municipal Corporation in order to strengthen the Panchayati Raj system. The panchayat teachers, about 1,50,000 in number, are paid a starting salary of Rs. 8,500 a month and the have not been working since December 3. The teachers employed by the education department have a starting salary of close to Rs. 20,000. We should be given the same [salary] and allowed to work under the Education Ministry, rather than the panchayat, said a seemingly agitated Sanjay Sharma, main coordinator of the Teacher Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella organisation of nine panchayat teachers association. Turns Tahrir Square Sapre School Ground in central Raipur has turned in to the Tahrir Square for Chhattisgarhs teachers. More than 50,000 teachers and their families, including one-year-old children, are spending days and nights on the ground. Some have plastic sheets for shade, while some are sheltered under makeshift tents. Aggressive slogans are raised taking a clear dig at Chief Minister Raman Singh and his administration The reason is simple, said Sebak Ram of Baloda Bazar, while playing with his one-and-a-half-year-old daughter, we have been seriously demeaned by this government. Our salary is less than what the peons get and we report to the panchayat department despite being full-scale teachers. But what is worrying a section of the administration more than the teachers demands is the armed party, CPI (Maoist)s solidarity with the teachers movement. On Saturday, a bandh called by the CPI (Maoist) was observed in Narainpur district supporting the teachers demands. A couple of days ago, local newspapers reported that teachers were shouting Lal Salam  the Red Salute  and threatening to take up arms on the Sapre School Ground, if their demands were ignored. Red slogans A Raipur-based intelligence official said: This is nonsense, have you heard anything like that. On Saturday afternoon, while no one was shouting Lal Salam, most of the speakers were closing their speeches with Inquilab Zindabad (Long Live the Revolution). Police officials refused to comment if such a frequent use of a phrase, which hailed revolution, could provoke unrest in a State that was substantially controlled by an armed communist party strongly advocating revolution. The government, however, has clearly refused to acknowledge the demands of the teachers. In a meeting between the States Education and Panchayat Minister and the association, teachers were told that their demands were unreasonable.  They are under the panchayat because the 11th schedule of the 73rd Amendment clearly said that in order to strengthen the panchayat, various departments  including education  are to be brought under it. Besides, when they took up the job they knew it was under the panchayat as the Education Departments jobs were frozen, said one of the top officials of the State. No meeting was scheduled between the Chief Minister and other concerned to discuss the subject, the official informed. Teachers decide The teachers, however, believe that since they play a critical role in the Chhattisgarh election, the government will have to listen to them. Teachers decide if the party [BJP] would win or lose, as we work as election agents. The government will listen to us if they would like to win in next years election, said Sebak Ram, while singing a popular Hindi song to his daughter. The teachers want to come under Education Department, not panchayats; reports that some agitators are threatening to take up armsWhile starting pay for panchayat teachers is Rs. 8,500, those employed by Education Department get a starting of close to Rs. 20,000 The teachers want to come under Education Department, not panchayats; reports that some agitators are threatening to take up arms While starting pay for panchayat teachers is Rs. 8,500, those employed by Education Department get a starting of close to Rs. 20,000  OPEN",

        "content": " Shouting No-to-MFN [status to India] slogans, the Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC) staged a protest march to the Wagah border on Sunday; showing not just its opposition to increased bilateral trade but also flaunting a new map of an Islamic South Asia. After lying low for several months, the DPC has reactivated itself as the scheduled date for operationalising Pakistans decision to grant Most Favoured Nation status to India approaches. It is due to come into effect from next month. And, since the day it chose for this protest action was also the 41st anniversary of Pakistan signing the Instrument of Surrender in 1971 leading to the creation of Bangladesh, the DPC leadership played on that with the new map of Islamic South Asia. They made new maps of South Asia. Today, we present you a new map of Islamic South Asia, said JuD leader Ameer Hamza. The DPC leadership  including those of the Jamat-ud-Dawah (JuD)  attached considerable importance to the significance of the protest march moving towards Wagah border. The first time in 64 years, a caravan has moved towards India from Lahore. We have returned to the Wagah border to remind the promise to Muslims of Kashmir and Gujarat, the speakers said, denouncing Interior Minister Rehman Malik for advocating friendship with India  a country with the blood of Muslims on its hands. Farmers concerns ignored According to the DPC leadership, farmers of Pakistan and the pharma industry had major apprehensions of open trade with India but the federal Commerce Ministry had ignored their concerns in its haste to grant MFN status to India. Further, it alleged that India was not interested in equal trade but in taking over Pakistans markets and ensuring access for its products into Afghanistan. Ironically, even as the DPC leadership was building up its anti-India rhetoric, visiting All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq advocated further opening of trade between the two Kashmirs to help the peace process. He is leading a seven-member APHC delegation to Pakistan at the invitation of the federal government and is expected to hold discussions with the senior-most leadership of the country over the next week. With the local media not giving the DPC protest march the kind of coverage it used to get when this platform of religious right wing forces was launched last year, the various constituents of this grouping used the social media to send across their message through the day, posting photographs on their Facebook pages and tweeting along the way.

The girlfrom Peermedu in Idukki district of Kerala was hired by the MLA during the last week of June. On June 29, she was alleged to have consumed some poisonous substance and admitted to a hospital here. Later, she was taken to a Tiruchi hospital and then to the Government Medical College Hospital, Theni, where she was pronounced dead on July 6. After two post-mortems, a case was filed against the MLA and three others under sections 366(A), 376(rape) and 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. They have been remanded in judicial custody and lodged in the Central Prison, Tiruchi. All the four were subjected to medical examination at the Annai Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, Tiruchi, on Thursday.

The violence, which struck during morning rush hour amid tightened security ahead of the polls, also wounded more than 210 people and raises further questions about the credibility of the April 20 vote, seen as a key test of Iraq's stability and its security forces' capabilities. A total of 14 election hopefuls have already been murdered and just 12 of the country's 18 provinces will be taking part. Officials said 20 car bombs exploded on Monday in Baghdad, the northern cities of Kirkuk, Tuz Khurmatu, Mosul and Tikrit, the central city of Samarra, and Hilla and Nasiriyah south of Baghdad. Roadside bombs also hit Baquba, north of the capital, and there was a shooting near Baghdad. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Sunni militants linked to Al-Qaeda frequently attack both government targets and civilians in a bid to destabilise the country, and have reportedly sought to intimidate candidates ahead of polls. The deadliest attacks were in Baghdad, where six car bombs struck in five neighbourhoods despite tougher checkpoint searches and heightened security. Among them was a car bomb in a parking area used by vehicles making their way to Baghdad's heavily-guarded airport.AFP  OPEN",

But a new e-mail, reportedly by the Indian Mujahideen (IM), claimed that it was behind the incident  and not the Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islami  and dared the security agencies to prevent another explosion planned by it at a shopping complex next week. Reward announced Police have detained five persons in Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir and one in Uttar Pradesh in connection with the blast. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has announced a reward of Rs. 5 lakh to anyone providing clues about the explosion. Secretary (Internal Security) in the Home Ministry U.K. Bansal said teams of Anti-Terror Squads from the neighbouring States were coming here for consultations with the NIA and the Delhi Police to help in the probe. Forensic science experts from Gandhinagar and Hyderabad scanned the blast site on Thursday and the NIA was vigorously pursuing various leads and looking at all possible connections. On the new e-mail, Mr. Bansal said the investigators were examining it to determine its authenticity. The first e-mail, sent by Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islami, was traced to the Global Cyber Caf in Kishtwar district. Its owner and four others were being questioned by police. The person detained in Balrampur in U.P., resembled one of the sketches released by the Delhi Police and his identity and antecedents were being verified, well placed sources said.Intelligence experts said the latest claim  by IM  could be a ploy to perplex the investigators and turn out to be a prank. The IM claimed that the HuJI had no role in the blast. Earlier in the day, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram presided over a meeting of the chiefs of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), Intelligence Bureau and the NIA and reviewed the security scenario. The Home Ministry has entrusted the probe into the May 25 blast in the Delhi High Court to the NIA.

XII student, went for tuition on the morning of June 6. But she did not return home, perhaps joining the growing number of children taken away for arms training by militants across the international border. Her mother, Premkumari Laishram, told journalists that Babina managed to call the relatives up from the border town of Moreh and informed them that she was kept somewhere along the Moreh river, pleading with them to save her. On the night of June 13, a man, claiming to be an insurgent, informed the family that the girl was in the custody of the outfit, she would soon be sent out for training, and they could meet her after three months. But James Khaidem, 15, and Vijakumar Oinam, 17, were lucky. They were rescued by police commandos in Thoubal district on June 14, while being taken to Myanmar in a van by two insurgents for conscription into a faction of the Kangleipak Communist Party. The boys were promised Rs.1,50,000 each on arrival along the international border. On March 10, Alice Kamei and Sanahanbi Khaidem were lured by a banned outfit out of their hostel in Bishnupur district. While the parents of Khaidem did not protest, student and youth organisations of the Zeliangrong tribe launched a protest, as Kamei belongs to the tribe. However, the outfit claimed that the girls had joined up on their own.  OPEN",

        "content": "  The Madras High Court has recently resolved a 45-year-old dispute between a contractor and Southern Railway over calculation of charges for the civil works carried out by him before the construction of a diesel locomotive shed at Erode in 1965. Justice M. Venugopal resolved the dispute while disposing of an Appeal Suit filed by the Union of India, represented by the General Manager, Southern Railway, against a judgement passed by a lower court in 2001 in favour of the contractor in a civil suit filed by him in 1969. The appellant claimed that the lower court had come to an erroneous conclusion that the contractor had cleared 9,81,000 cubic feet of rubble and ordered a payment of Rs.2,78,604 though as per records he had cleared only 6,17,816 cubic feet and entitled to Rs.46,153. Not part of written agreement On the other hand, the contractor stated that the works related to clearing the rubble was not part of the written agreement to build the loco shed. Yet, he agreed to do the job only after the then Executive Engineer Railways agreed to pay him Rs.284 per 1,000 cubic feet. But he never expected a volte face. After completion of the work, the higher officials said that they would make the payment only at the rate of around Rs.29 per cubic metre as per the Basic Schedule of Rates (BSR), 1961. The contractor received the money under protest and filed the suit claiming the balance due to him. Finding force in his submission, Mr. Justice Venugopal said that the Southern Railway, which had benefited out of the civil work done by the contractor, was bound to pay the latter at the rate of Rs.284 per 1,000 cubic feet especially when the quantum had been agreed upon by the then Executive Engineer. The judge pointed out that Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 speaks of obligation of a person enjoying benefits of a non-gratuitous act. It is to be borne in mind that a claim for compensation by one individual against another as per Section 70 of the Act is not based on any subsisting contract. Terms of contract Its basis is that something has been done by one party for the other which the other side has accepted voluntarily, he said and held that a person could claim payment for work done beyond the terms of contract if the other person had availed the benefits of the work. However, pointing out that no document had been filed to prove the removal of over 9 lakh cubic feet of rubble, the judge directed the Railways to pay the amount to the contractor for removing 6.17 lakh cubic feet at the rate of Rs.284 per 1,000 cubic feet.

        "content": " Even as the territorial administration tries to revive the Rs.10-crore fishing harbour project at Pudukuppam, environmental activists and farmers in Bahour have decided to intensify their protest against the fish landing facility if the government goes ahead with the scheme. The project to provide fish landing facility on the Mullodai backwaters at Pudukuppam village by cutting open the sea mouth was first taken up by the Fisheries Department in 2009 by getting funds from the World Bank. Even as the Public Works Department was about to complete the work on constructing the jetty, environmental groups and farmers raised objection. Following intervention of the Lieutenant Governor, all work related to the harbour was stopped in 2010. The decision to revive the project came to light after the Fisheries Department convened a meeting of stakeholders on Wednesday to discuss the proposed project to cut open of sea mouth to connect Mullodoi backwaters at Pudukuppam fishing village. Several organisations under the banner Alliance for Good Governance (AGG) met the Deputy Collector (South), who was to chair the meeting, and informed him of their decision to stay away from the consultation process citing lack of clarity. Before boycotting the meeting, the AGG submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Collector In the memorandum, representatives of seven organisations urged the Deputy Collector to explain the circumstances under which the project was revived and put on public domain details such as feasibility report of the project, environment impact assessment report and clearance for the project from the Ministry. Talking to The Hindu , Probir Banerjee of AGG said if need arises, the AGG would even approach court. The AGG opposed the project on several counts, he said, adding that the main argument is that the establishment of the fishing harbour in Thavalakuppam had resulted in massive sea erosion in the neighbouring coastal villages north of Puducherry, and one more harbour would spell disaster to the coastline in Puducherry and neighbouring Tamil Nadu. The proposed harbour would lead to sea erosion in Bahour area, which is known for its vegetation. Apart from aggravating the misery of fishermen residing in north of Puducherry and Veerampattinam area, farmers of Bahour would lose their livelihood because of sea water intrusion into aquifers, he said. The government could not give a convincing answer on what would happen when the mouth of sea is cut and when huge quantum of seawater gushes into the backwater area, which is on a lower plain. No agency conducted a study to asses the impact, he added. At this point it is pertinent to note a report submitted by a government-appointed scientist on the project. At the height of the protest, the Chief Conservator of Forests (Central), Ministry of Environment and Forests, Southern Region, appointed a one-man committee to assess the environmental impact of the project. The committee, in its report, a copy of which The Hindu accessed, said, after site visit and after discussing the issues with all persons concerned, it is evident that the apprehensions expressed by the environmental activists appears to be genuine. Minor fishing harbours may not be having much impact in other parts of the country where there are fewer habitations in the vicinity, where as the coastline of Pondicherry and adjoining Tamil Nadu is thickly populated; even a minor impact will affect a huge population. The report further said, even though the project is some what useful to the fishermen of that area, unless environmental safeguards are strictly implemented, this project may create a similar situation as of the old fishing harbour. It went on to add, for the old fishing harbour, it was informed that even though on some earlier occasions, some of the authorities concerned have attempted to address the problem of coastal erosion, the measures taken for the old harbour remains inadequate and not comprehensive. The attempts made were too small and on piecemeal basis, thus the efforts are not successful in controlling the erosion problems.   OPEN",

Achuthanandan's plea for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the lottery scam. Talking to The Hindu here on Saturday, Mr. Veerendrakumar also justified the former Supreme Court judge V.R. Krishna Iyer's demand for a judicial probe into the allegation that P.V. Sreenijan, son-in-law of the former Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan, had amassed assets disproportionate to his known source of income. Mr. Veerendrakumar said Mr. Achuthanandan was within his constitutional right to seek a CBI inquiry into the lottery scam as every year other State lotteries took away nearly Rs.80,000 crore from Kerala. The Chief Minister also suspected that a part of this money might have gone to financing militant groups. So, a CBI probe was both in the national and State interests, he said. Mr. Veerendrakumar said that though the Chief Minister was a nominee of the party that heads the government he had to rule under the provisions of the Constitution as he represented not the party but the entire people of the State. But the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said that he did not ask the party before seeking a CBI inquiry. This was a blatant interference in the constitutional powers of the Chief Minister and the Cabinet headed by him. Such extra-constitutional interference by the party was tantamount to subverting the Constitution. This could not be allowed in a democratic system, he said. Regarding Mr. Krishna Iyer's demand, he said the judiciary should be above suspicion. The allegation should be investigated since it affected the image a former Chief Justice of India who still held a very important constitutional position. Mr. Veerendrakumar said it was surprising that the DYFI that had threatened to bring out more revelations on the Sreenijan issue had abruptly ended its campaign on the issue. This showed that the CPI(M) had some vested interest in the issue, he added.  OPEN",

The region has been rocked by rioting, arson and a cycle of revenge attacks involving Buddhist Rakhine and Muslim Rohingya this month, leaving dozens of people dead and prompting growing international concern. The two defendants \"were sentenced to death as they were found guilty of murder, rape and robbery,\" the official said. \"The court told them they can appeal to the Supreme Court within seven days if they want.\" According to Amnesty International, no death row prisoner in Myanmar is known to have been executed since 1988. State media had described three suspects in the case as Bengali Muslims -- a term it uses to refer to the Rohingya, a stateless people viewed by the United Nations as among the world's most persecuted minorities. A third suspect hanged himself in prison earlier this month, according to the official New Light of Myanmar newspaper. In apparent revenge for the attack, a mob of several hundred Buddhists beat 10 Muslims to death on June 3, mistakenly believing the perpetrators were among them. About 800,000 Rohingya live in Myanmar, according to the UN, mostly in Rakhine. The Myanmar government considers them to be foreigners, while many citizens see them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and view them with hostility. Bangladesh, where an estimated 300,000 Rohingya live, has been turning back Rohingya boats arriving on its shores since the outbreak of unrest.AFP  OPEN",

Krishnan was regulating traffic in Kothavalchavadi on Saturday evening, little did he know that he would soon nab a waylayer and save an invitation cards company the sum of Rs. 2 lakh. At around 6.15 p.m., Krishnan was regulating traffic on Anderson-Annapillai Street, when he heard a huge commotion. People were shouting and when I went and had a look, a man holding a knife in one hand and a bag in the other, started running towards me, he said. Krishnan managed to catch the man, but the man wriggled out of his hold and began running again. I chased and caught up with him. With my left hand, I bent his arm, and held his own knife against his throat. He bit my other hand and tried to escape again. But I held on to him. Upon searching him, I found chilli powder in pocket and a large sum of money in the bag, Krishnan said. By then, Esplanade police officers had arrived, and they took in the man, who said his name was Shantakumar. Police said that Kumar confessed to waylaying the employee of a well-known invitation cards company, and robbing him of the weekly wages he was carrying. The plot was originally hatched by an employee of the company, Thirunavukarasu, who worked at the companys godown. Every Saturday, Kumar, another worker, brought the godown employees their wages. Thirunavukarasu told his friends Hemant, Ravi and Shantakumar about this, and the four of them planned to rob Kumar and share the loot, said K.N. Murali, assistant commissioner of police, Madras High Court. Thanks to Krishnans timely action, we managed to nab Shantakumar and find out about the robbery, Murali added. On Saturday, the four men waited at the Annapillai-Anderson street junction. When they spotted Kumar walking towards them, they snatched the bag of money from him at knifepoint. However, some passers-by saw the knife and began shouting for help. This is what attracted Krishnans attention, said Murali. Esplanade police then combed the locality and arrested Thirunavukarasu, Hemant and Ravi. All four were remanded to custody. Im very glad I managed to nab a thief, said Krishnan.

The mining activities in the reserve forest areas in Sandur, Hospet and Bellary were under the scanner of many mining and forest regulatory bodies. In addition, the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) appointed by the Apex Court was also looking into the illegal mining there. In its letter of October 18, 2010, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (Forest Conservation Division) had also stated, In furtherance of the objective of controlling illegalities in mining areas, the Central Government has decided to impose moratorium on all fresh mining lease applications in Bellary district with immediate effect. If, based on the recommendations of the Conservator of Forests of Bellary Circle, the clearances were accorded to some companies, they would be in total violation of the Union Government's own moratorium', Mr. Ganesh said.

Chandrasekharan, on Saturday, sought the removal of 18 persons, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI-M] State committee member K.K. Ragesh, from the list of 76 accused in the case. The counsel argued before the Special Additional District and Sessions Court (Marad cases) at Eranhipalam that there were no evidence or material documents to prove the charges framed against Karayi Sreedharan, Kariyath Valsan (accused number 53 and 54), P. Govindan, V.P. Shijeesh, Rajeesh, K. Madanan, Anandan, Sudheesh, T. Prabakaran, Raghavan, Kaippacheri Rameshan, Kaippacheri Sudhakaran, Chembadan Janardhanan, K.K. Ragesh (accused number 58 to 69), V. Angajan, Ponnathu Kumaran, Ponnathu Rajan, and K. Yoosaf (accused numbers 71 to 74). Special Judge R. Narayana Pisharadi would deliver the verdict on the argument on December 19. The arguments were put forth by the defence and prosecution sides of the case, when the court was continuing with the preliminary hearing, a legal procedure followed to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to carry out a trial in a case. The court would fix the day for beginning the trial possibly in the second week of February and schedule the dates for examining the witnesses on December 20. The case related to a section of CPI(M) leaders in Kozhikode and Kannur districts hatching a plot and engaging a seven-member killer gang to kill Chandrasekharan at Vallikkad near Onchiyam on May 4. Chandrasekharan had walked out of the CPI (M) and had floated a dissident outfit, posing a challenge to the party in rural Kozhikode. The defence lawyers argued that the Special Investigation Team that probed the Chandrasekharan murder case had included many persons as accused without any evidence. In some instances, police personnel had named witnesses to give statements against these persons. The statements of some accused were taken into account to frame charges against these 18 persons. Such moves were against criminal justice system, they argued. However, Special Prosecutor P. Kumarankutty argued that the cases against 18 persons had been registered based on the proof that they had provided shelter to the prime accused. Whether the 18 persons were involved or not should be taken up only during the stages of the trial, he said. Defence lawyers, M. Ashokan, P.V. Hari, K. Viswan, K. Ajithkumar, Vinod Kumar, N.R. Shanavas and P. Sasi appeared for the accused.

Addressing a news conference here on Saturday, Hindu Aikya Vedi president K.P.

The Chief Minister was not ready to seek an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the killing of nine fishermen on Marad beach even after the ruling and Opposition parties had demanded it, Ms. Sasikala said. The Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League ( IUML) had alleged that a CBI probe would not be impartial, she added.

Twenty-year-old Rekha Kumari, a resident of Peepar in Jodhpur district, has approached the Sub-Divisional Officer with a request to annul her marriage solemnised 15 years ago with a boy four years elder to her. She sought protection from the village panchayat members who, she said, were threatening her family. According to police sources, the village panchayat threatened to expel her family from the locality and warned of heavy fines if she did not accept her childhood marriage and start living with the man, who incidentally is also threatening to abduct her. Rekha, presently studying at the Government College in Peepar, was married off by her grandfather when she was only five years old. Her gauna' (shift to in-laws' house) is yet to be performed. Illiterate man After her grandfather's recent death, the in-laws have been asking Rekha's parents to send her to their house. The girl is not willing to live with the illiterate man who she says has no future. Even as Rekha has cited incompatibility as the reason for her desire to reject her childhood marriage, which in any case was illegal, the boy follows her to the college, abuses her and has allegedly threatened to abduct her if does not agree to come with him. Police have provided security to Rekha and her family members and issued a warning to the panchayat not to put any kind of pressure on the family. The boy and his family have been specifically warned to keep away from the girl. In another instance, 23-year-old Santara, a resident of Manpuria village in Dausa district, has refused to go back to her husband's home, saying she was married in childhood when did not know anything about nuptial relations. She has lodged a complaint with the police accusing her community elders of pressurising her to live with the man. Panchayat pressure The school teacher, married to one Dinesh Meena 14 years ago, has been provided police security. She stated in her complaint that the local panchayat had issued an order to her to return to her husband's house even though she was unwilling to treat her marriage as valid. The cases of educated girls married in childhood seeking to nullify their relationship for different reasons have been reported with regularity, particularly in western Rajasthan districts, during the past few months. Earlier this month, Shobha Chaudhary moved the Rajasthan High Court in Jodhpur for dissolution of her childhood marriage and alleged that the caste panchayat had slapped a fine of Rs.9 lakh on her family for her act of defiance. Similarly, a minor girl reported to the district authorities her family's plan to marry her off on the Akha Teej festival.  OPEN",

Thresiamma, aged 55, and her three-year-old granddaughter, hailing from Varavukalayil house in Nambyakulam in Kanakkary village, were attacked and injured by a cow near a paddy field around 9.30 a.m. Both the injured later slipped and fell into a deep canal nearby. Ashwathy, a teacher of the Vivekananda Public School in Kurumulloor located nearby, was passing by and saw the woman and the child struggling to reach safety, and cried for help. Five of her students, Vishnu A. Nair, Sanal Stalin, Justin M. Varghese, Mahesh Sharma and Vishnu Chandran, who also happened to be in the area, rushed to the scene and lost no time in diving in to save the two lives. The students immediately brought the child to safety. Soon, another man who was on the school premises, sprang into action and rescued the woman. Thresiamma and the child were later admitted to a private hospital at Thellakom. The daring efforts of the teenagers soon became the talk of the town. The heroes were also lauded by the school principal Suseela Balakrishnan.  Five students saved Thresiamma and her granddaughter from drowning.  OPEN",

        "content": " A four-member committee appointed by the State government visited the Beypore Port on Saturday to check the technical issues behind the construction of a wharf that was remaining unused for long time. The team headed by R. Sundaravadivelu, former head of the department of ocean engineering, IIT, Madras, examined the site in detail and would submit a report to the government. According to the preliminary evaluation of the committee, there was nothing wrong with the construction of the wharf and hence any modification on the structure was not necessary. However, the team members seriously considered the scope of altering one of the already constructed breakwaters in the area, which was playing spoilsport in the effective functioning of the wharf. Though the wharf was constructed in 2003, ships were not able to use it owing to the strong waves against the structure. According to officials, the waves became more annoying as something went wrong with the construction of the breakwater in the southern edge. Port Officer Abraham V. Kuriakose, who was also one of the members in the committee, said they would look into the possibility of making some modifications in the existing structure of the breakwater in the southern side while preparing the final report. The committee members have already expressed their suggestion of extending the length of the breakwater besides making some modifications in its present direction, he said. C.G. Nandakumar, Professor, Department of Ship Technology, CUSAT, and M. Rajiv, superintendent, Department of Harbour Engineering, were the other members in the team.

        "content": " The Human Rights Watch (HRW), a global human rights organisation, has sought an international investigation into reports of sexual violence, rape, third degree torture against Tamil women and men carried out by the Sri Lankan security forces to get confessions from those suspected to have links with the then Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The HRW, which has prepared a 140-page report, We Will Teach You a Lesson: Sexual Violence against Tamils by Sri Lankan Security Forces, which is to be released on Monday, provides detailed accounts of 75 cases of alleged rape and sexual abuse that occurred from 2006 to 2012 in both official and secret detention centres throughout Sri Lanka. While widespread rape in custody occurred during the armed conflict (with LTTE) that ended in May 2009, HRW found that politically motivated sexual violence by the military and police continues to the present. HRW Asia Director Brad Adams claimed: The Sri Lankan security forces have committed untold numbers of rapes of Tamil men and women in custody. These are not just wartime atrocities but continue to the present, putting every Tamil man/woman arrested for suspected LTTE involvement at serious risk. Mr. Adams said the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) should direct the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to conduct an independent international investigation. The governments response to allegations of sexual violence by its security forces has been dismissive, deeming them fake or pro-LTTE propaganda. Its not clear who in the government knew about these horrific crimes. But the governments failure to take action against these ongoing abuses is further evidence of the need for an international investigation, he said. Victims accounts Quoting from the accounts of a 31-year-old Tamil woman who was picked up from her Colombo house by CID personnel in November 2011, the HRW said: I was taken to the fourth floor of the CID office in Colombo. I was not given any food or water. The next day, the officials, who included a uniformed armed official, photographed me, took my fingerprints, and made me sign on a blank sheet of paper. They told me that they had all my husbands details and kept asking me to disclose his whereabouts. When I told them my husband was abroad, they continued to accuse him of supporting the LTTE. I was beaten with many objects. I was burned with a cigarette during questioning. I was slapped around and beaten with a sand-filled pipe. Throughout the beatings, they asked me for my husbands details. I was raped one night. Two men came to my room in civilian clothes. They ripped my clothes and both raped me. They spoke Sinhala so I could not understand anything. It was dark so I couldnt see their faces clearly. Another 23-year-old male youth, caught in August 2012, said: They removed my blindfold [and] I found myself in a room where four other men were present. I was tied to a chair and questioned about my links to the LTTE and the reason for my recent travel abroad. They stripped me and started beating me. I was beaten with electric wires, burned with cigarettes and suffocated with a petrol-infused polythene bag. Later that night, I was left in a smaller room. I was raped on three consecutive days. The first night, one man came alone and anally raped me. The second and third night, two men came to my room. They anally raped me and also forced me to have oral sex with them. I signed a confession admitting my links with the LTTE after the rapes. Yet another youth, who surrendered before the security forces in May 2009, said: Two officials held my arms back [while] a third official held my penis and inserted a metal rod inside. They inserted small metal balls inside my penis. These had to be surgically removed after I escaped from the country. A medical report corroborates his account, said HRW. The rights body alleged that the victims also described being beaten, hung by their arms, partially asphyxiated and burned with cigarettes. None of those who spoke to HRW had access to legal counsel, family members, or doctors while they were detained. Most said that they signed a confession in the hope that the abuse would stop, though the torture, including rape, often continued. The individuals interviewed were not formally released but rather allowed to escape after a relative paid the authorities a bribe.

The team representing members from different organisations released a report on the forced eviction and rehabilitation of slum dwellers in Chennai here on Thursday, which would also be submitted to the government. Addressing a press conference, V. Suresh, president, PUCL, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, said the procedures of the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy (NRRP) had been violated by forcefully evicting slum dwellers and by carrying out the eviction during the monsoon and in the middle of the academic year. While the carpet size of a house to be provided for a family should be 538.2 sq. ft. as per NRRP 2007, members said that the houses provided are only 160 sq. ft.

An age old problem for the old city, this problem refuses to die down. In the latest instance, Moghalpura police arrested Krishnadevi alias Nagin alias Bhabhi, an alleged sorceress, from Sultanshahi on charges of cheating following a complaint made to the police. She was arrested earlier on similar charges but resumed her trade soon after coming out on bail. This time around, local residents of the area staged a protest in front of the Moghalpura police station demanding that stringent action be taken against her. The irate residents are believed to have served a notice on her to leave the locality immediately. This is not an isolated case. In the last few years the police have launched several drives to contain the problem but failed to succeed. Because of the lucrative nature of the trade, police action fails to act as a deterrent. As soon as they come out on bail, they are back in the game. They make up the expenses incurred on securing the bail by attending just one client, says a police official. It is believed that some of the faith healers have now shifted their base to other areas in old city such as Shaheennagar, Errakunta, Hassanagar, Mir Momin Pahadi and Bandlaguda area that fall under the jurisdiction of Cyberabad police. And then there are a few babas carrying on with their business at Puranapul, Jhirrah, Golconda and Langer Houz. They engage the services of brokers to get customers, it is said.

Tension continues to haunt the inhabitants who have been living under the shadow of a police picket for over a week. A peace committee was constituted with representatives from the warring communities and local leaders at the instance of Superintendent of Police M. Ramesh, who visited the village on Friday, to restore peace and order. Local MLA V. Sivarama Raju of the TDP also visited the trouble-torn village on Saturday to broker peace between the two communities. Peace was shattered in the village when people from the Kalinga community, falling under Backward Classes, installed a statue of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, a cult figure of the Backward Classes, on the bunds of a drinking water tank. The SCs reportedly expressed their strong opposition against use of the premises allegedly meant for them for statue installation by the BCs. Instead, they also prepared for installation of a statue of their own caste icon Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on the same premises, leading to a showdown between the two communities. The police swung into action and removed the statue put up by the BCs and stalled the attempts of the SCs from committing such acts. In the meantime, the rival communities reportedly clashed by resorting to stone-pelting in the light of allegation of a social boycott involving the SCs. Milk vendors who procure milk from the BCs were allegedly coerced into suspension of delivery of milk to the SC families. A forum named Dalit Ikhya Vedika was formed with leaders from different political parties and caste outfits to fight for the cause of the local SCs. Even the sprawling drinking water tank in the village has not been spared from caste prejudice. The tank bunds were used for installation of over a dozen statues of the leaders of national fame. The tank bunds have been divided into four revus (points in Telugu) with delegation of rights over drawl of water to four communities from the village such as Kshatriya, Bramhin, BC and SC communities. Currently, the tank became a battleground for a bloody caste war. The village, with around 800 families, is dominated by Kalingas due to their numerical strength, followed by SCs and Kshatriyas. Kalingas were said to have migrated from north coastal districts in search of employment some seven decades ago.  OPEN",

Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Kumaraswamy lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party Government for illegally constituting a committee headed by its party MLA without securing the consent of Opposition leaders, and conspiring to suspend Opposition MLAs. He said Speaker K.G. Bopaiah had constituted the committee based only on complaints from the ruling party members. Mr. Kumaraswamy said he would shortly meet the Governor and explain to him the illegalities committed by the Government. In case the Speaker comes forward to suspend the Opposition MLAs after accepting the House Committee report, Mr. Kumaraswamy said, the Janata Dal (Secular) will launch a struggle against the BJP Government. The party will jointly chalk out a plan with the Opposition Congress to oppose the BJP, he said. Instead of facilitating a smooth discussion in the legislature session on the charges of corruption levelled against him, the Chief Minister was trying the muzzle the voice of the Opposition., Mr Kumaraswamy said.

What this means is that the Government order closing down the once well-known public sector unit has been set aside. More importantly, the Bench has allowed petitions by more than 1,600 employees of the company who have been waging a battle against their retrenchment. Initially, the company had 1,800 members on its rolls. After the Government decided to close it down, the matter was referred to the High Court for liquidation. During the liquidation proceedings, the number of employees came down to 1,350. The Bench has asked the Government to give a fresh hearing to the representation by the employees and take a decision as per the law. It also asked the Government to ensure that the workers are paid their dues. Mysore Acetate In another company case, Justice H.N.

        "content": " The killing of an elephant in the Sathyamangalam forests by poachers has once again brought back the focus on strengthening anti-poaching initiatives. The Sathyamangalam forest, which has over 850 elephants, has lost at least three tuskers in the last three years. A 16-year-old elephant was shot dead in the Aasanur forest range a few days ago. In November 2009, a 30-year-old elephant was gunned down by poachers in the Bhavanisagar range for its valuable ivory. Another incident of poaching was reported in 2008 in Kali Thimbam in the same range. In May 2009, unidentified persons removed the tusks from an elephant which died due to natural causes. Most of these incidents, according to the forest sources, were committed by small-time poachers, who mainly operated in the jungles straddling Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, where forest brigand Veerappan once reigned and killed a large number of elephants. Most of these poachers had begun roaming the Sathyamangalam forests soon after Veerappan was eliminated. Organised poaching is almost non-existent now. Even in the recent incident, poachers did not come with the purpose of poaching the jumbo. If they did, they would not have killed a sub-adult, whose tusks do not carry a high value in the market, pointed out a forest officer. Though the Forest Department's vigil against poaching was high, the recent incident called for more initiatives to put an end to the menace, wildlife conservationists said. Officials said that a number of initiatives had already been implemented to prevent poaching in Sathyamangalam forests. To strengthen the vigil further, it was planned to equip the anti-poaching watchers with modern equipment, including night vision binoculars, and appropriate training, it was pointed out. We are also co-ordinating operations with our counterparts in Karnataka to monitor the movement of poachers. An enhanced inter-state co-ordination was vital in an anti-poaching drive, a senior official said.  OPEN",

        "content": " Expressing concern over heightened levels of violence against political workers in West Bengal, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the number of killings was alarming and pointed to a virtual collapse of law and order in parts of the State. In his letter of December 30, 2010 to West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, a copy of which was released on Friday, the Home Minister said that he had used the word harmad' (hired killers) in an earlier letter as it was extensively used in the media, but would use any other word to describe armed cadres that Mr. Bhattacharjee would care to suggest. Mr. Bhattacharjee had taken strong exception to the use of the nasty word in Mr. Chidambaram's letter last week. Mr. Chidambaram agreed with Mr. Bhattacharjee that it was not a happy situation considering the level of violence in the State. He had on Thursday sent two letters to Mr. Bhattacharjee, in reply to the Chief Minister's December 28 communication. Both letters were faxed as well as sent by speed post. While you have put the number of Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadres killed and injured at 69 and 723 respectively, according to our information they are 65 and 773 respectively. The figures are not very different. In fact, there is broad agreement on the numbers killed and injured. If our numbers are broadly correct in the case of CPI(M) cadres killed and injured, there is no reason to doubt our numbers regarding Trinamool Congress and Congress cadres killed and injured. These numbers have been gathered in [a uniform] manner and from the same sources. Taken together, the numbers are alarming and that is why I said that they point to a virtual collapse of law and order in parts of West Bengal, Mr. Chidambaram said in the letter. Agreeing with the Chief Minister's view that the CPI (Maoist) had a significant presence in three districts of West Bengal and that the challenge was containing them both administratively and politically, he pointed out that it was towards this end that the Centre provided substantial support by deploying Central forces upon request. The question that remains unanswered in your letter is: if armed cadres continue to take upon themselves the duties of maintaining law and order, what is the role of the security forces, especially of the Central paramilitary forces that have been deployed at the request of the State government, he said. In the second letter, Mr. Chidambaram clarified his use of the word harmad' to describe the armed cadres. I do not think that the word is per se offensive but, should you suggest another word or phrase to describe the armed cadres referred to in my letter, I shall be happy to use that word or phrase, he said. Both of us should focus on the substance of my letter and not be distracted by extraneous matters, Mr. Chidambaram said. He also invited Mr. Bhattacharjee to the capital for a frank discussion on this extremely sensitive issue, to agree upon the way forward, indicating his availability from January 3 to January 7, 2011.

In a curious turn of events, after locking the resident and her son in the house, the woman fled on a motorcycle by tricking the rider, an acquaintance of the victim. Sources with the Royapettah police identified the victim as Venmathi (32) and said the robbery took place at her ground-floor residence at Pudupet Garden 3{+r}{+d}Street in Royapettah. Around 2 p.m. on Tuesday, Venmathi was feeding her five-year-old son who had returned from school. As the boy insisted on watching television, she locked the house and went to her in-laws house next door. Within 15 minutes, she returned with her son to find a woman, dressed in a yellow sari and beads, coming out of her house. A shocked Venmathi questioned the women who claimed to be a devotee. The suspect, who had pocketed the gold and the cash from the house, told Venmathi that she had come in search of one Vijaya, a milk-sachet vendor. When Venmathi confronted her, she claimed she had got the wrong address and started crying, claiming that she was a devotee and not a thief. Then she asked for some water to drink, said an investigating officer. While Venmathi and her son were entering the house, the suspect pushed them inside, bolted the main door from outside and fled. Hearing Venmathis cries for help, her mother-in-law came to the spot and the two women along with neighbours went searching for the woman. The suspect, however, got a ride on a motorcycle with an acquaintance of Venmathi, residing on the adjoining street, after convincing him that her grandson had been in an accident an hour before and was admitted at the Government Royapettah Hospital. The man, who came to know the truth later, dropped her near the hospital from where she escaped. The Royapettah police have registered a case and are investigating.  Suspect fled by tricking victims acquaintance into giving her a ride to Royapettah hospital  OPEN",

The hearings by a division bench comprising Chief Justice J. N. Patel and Justice Ashim Kumar Roy on the PIL that was filed by the Calcutta High Court Bar Association on January 10 seeking, among other things, a CBI inquiry into the incident at Netai, concluded on Friday. Questioning the neutrality of a State agency like the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which is currently conducting the investigations, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, counsel for the Bar Association, pointed out the lapses in the investigations carried out so far and said that a CBI probe was necessary in this exceptional incident. However, the State Advocate-General representing the West Bengal Government, Balai Roy, said that investigations into the incident had been initiated speedily and the case was handed over to the CID on January 8. He also responded to allegations that the police took a long time responding to the situation in Netai and reached the area only at 12-15 p.m. though information about the violence had reached them nearly three hours before. The police had anticipated Maoist presence in the area and the joint security forces had been mobilised. According to the standard operating procedure, the forces had not been moved to the spot in vehicles as landmines may have been present, but they proceeded on foot, Mr. Roy said. The matter of granting interim compensation to the victims was also raised. While the issue of letters being exchanged between Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram and West Bengal Chief Minister on the existence of the armed camps was raised, Mr. Balai Roy said it was not a subject matter of the case. The High Court had earlier directed the West Bengal Home Secretary to submit an affidavit stating the Government's position on several issues related to the incident at Netai. The affidavit was filed on Thursday.  OPEN",

After a few bites, the customers complained that they had been served leftover food and a heated argument followed. Rajesh, who himself runs a food stall in Uttam Nagar, tried to force waiter Monu (22) to eat his leftover food to prove his point that they had been served stale food, but Monu refused to oblige. At this, Rajesh along with his friends beat up Monu and some passers-by gathered at the spot hearing the waiter scream for help and tried to intervene. Undeterred, an enraged Rajesh pulled out a pistol and opened fire at Monu, said a senior police officer. But the bullet missed the target and hit the roof of the dhaba near the entrance. It led to a ruckus and several people gathered at the dhaba on hearing the gunshot. Sensing danger, the trio tried to escape. But soon constable Dharambir, who was on patrolling duty in the area, reached the dhaba and managed to catch Rajesh. His two accomplices, however, managed to escape on foot. The .32 bore pistol from which the shot was fired and two live cartridges have been seized. A Santro car, which bore a Delhi registration number and belonged to the accused, was also impounded. We have definite leads on the two accused and raids are being conducted to arrest them. It is also being verified whether Rajesh and his friends have any previous criminal involvements, said the officer. Rajesh, a resident of Uttam Nagar, also runs a gymnasium, the police sources said. Monu, the victim, is a resident of Uttar Pradesh. A case of attempt to murder and under several sections of the Arms Act has been registered at the Connaught Place police station in this connection.

At their meeting, Ms. Sherman was quick to convey her personal condolences and deep regrets for those Indian nationals killed and injured off the coast of UAE by a U.S. Navy ship on 16 July, according to an official statement by the Indian Embassy in Washington. The statement of regret comes even as a Pentagon spokesman reiterated that USNS Rappahannock did employ a series of warning measures to alert the oncoming vessel. While Ms. Sherman said to Ms. Rao that the U.S. government was investigating the incident in a thorough and independent manner and would keep the Indian Government apprised of full facts of the incident, Pentagon spokesman George Little appeared to discount reports of the Dubai police chief saying that the U.S. Navy did not issue warnings to the fishermen. It remains our belief at this stage that warning measures were undertaken before shots were fired in this incident, he said adding, The incident remains under investigation, and we need to await the outcome of that investigation before reaching final conclusions. Mr. Little did not provide an answer to questions about the timeline for completion of the ongoing investigation into the incident and whether the U.S. would consider paying compensation to the fishermens families, as demanded by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa. The question of compensation really calls for speculation at this time, Mr. Little said. However he did admit that the NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service) has been part of the investigation, as you would expect, suggesting that there may be a potential criminal investigation into the incident.

        "content": " In the summer of 2011, production at Maruti Suzukis Manesar plant ground to a halt, as workers agitated to set up a union independent of the Maruti Udyog Kamdar Union that represented workers at the companys plant at Gurgaon. The strikes and lockouts eventually dragged on till the fall, and cost the company approximately $500 million in lost production. On Wednesday, nine months after the company finally agreed to recognise the Maruti Suzuki Workers Union, a violent confrontation between union representatives and the management, over suspension of a line worker, resulted in the death of a general manager, injuries to 100 managers and arson. We never expected this kind of occurrence, said Shinzo Nakanishi, Managing Director of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, adding, I am so shocked. We will de-recognise this union completely, said S.Y. Siddiqui, Marutis Chief Operating Officer, in an interview on Friday. There will be no compromise on violence. Yet, the dissolution of the union is unlikely to solve the companys problems. If last summers agitation hinged on the need for a union to fight for better working conditions, this year, the conflict appears to be a rising frustration that the union, created at great personal cost to the workers, was failing to deliver. Seen from the plate glass windows of the conference rooms on Marutis 600-acre campus at Manesar, the shop floor seems to be a serene union of men and machines. Car doors descend from conveyor belts located high up on the ceiling; engines rise up from the floor to be bolted on to elevated chassis. Yet, when this correspondent visited the plant last year, workers warned that the serenity could often prove false. The union was completely frustrated in its interactions with the management, which they felt wasnt budging an inch, said a labour activist, who was in close contact with union officers, and offered the example of the prolonged negotiations on a three-year pay settlement. Union representatives have refused to take calls after Wednesdays incident. While Mr. Siddiqui said pay negotiations were progressing smoothly, an April 23 report in the Mint newspaper noted that the union had asked the company to double salaries, improve health benefits, transport facilities and incentives. While the workers were asking for a raise of between Rs. 10,000 and 15,000, our opening offer was Rs. 10,500 for three years, said Mr. Siddiqui, adding that figures were far from finalized. An intermediary said that on Monday, July 16, workers were under the impression that Rs. 10,500 was actually the final settled increase staggered out in instalments of Rs. 6,000 in the first year, and Rs. 2,500 and Rs. 2,000 in subsequent years. Workers responded by boycotting the 20-minute morning meetings, said the source. Mr. Siddiqui confirmed that workers had stopped attending morning exercise meetings from Monday onwards, suggesting that trouble had been brewing before Wednesdays outburst, but Marutis Managing Director, Mr. Nakanishi insisted there was no link between the pay-settlement and Wednesdays violence. Union leaders elsewhere in Gurgaon say that the violence in Maruti is symptomatic of industry-wide unrest. Today, it isnt as if every plant in Gurgaon is violent, but no plant is totally peaceful, said Raj Kumar, president of the Autoworkers Union at Rico Auto Industries. The problem is that the management is unwilling to listen to workers. Today, there are no negotiations There are only fights. Maruti representatives, however, have noted that pay settlements with unions in their plants in Gurgaon and at Suzuki Powertrain Ltd have been largely peaceful.  OPEN",

Finding no grounds to reverse the trial court judgement, a Division Bench comprising Justice M. Jaichandren and Justice S. Nagamuthu said that in the present case, as basic a document as a complaint supposedly lodged by the victims brother to the police did not inspire the confidence of the court. According to the prosecution, the murder had taken place due to a long standing enmity between the victim Jeyasunder and the eight individuals J. Palaniraj, R. Ravi alias Muttakadai Ravi, P. Madhavan, S. Xavier, M. Sebastian, I. Kokku James alias James Alex, A. Ravi and A. Elangovan apart from their accomplices Krishnamoorthy who died even before the trial commenced and Charles who remained absconding. On the day of the incident, the ten individuals were waiting near the milk depot at about 5.30 am when the victim rode there in a motorcycle after dropping his brother Rokku alias Veeramohan a few metres before the place of occurrence. As per five eye-witnesses, the victim was assaulted brutally and attacked with deadly weapons leading to his death on the spot. However, the trial court acquitted all the eight on the ground that the evidence adduced by the eye witnesses, including the victims brother, was unbelievable and not worthy of acceptance as they had made contrary statements at different stages of the case. It also felt not safe to rely on their evidence especially when they were associated to the deceased in one way or the other. Agreeing with the lower court in toto, the Division Bench said: In our considered opinion too, these witnesses are highly unbelievable. They had spoken about the specific overt acts committed by all the ten accused during the course of investigation, but during the trial, for reasons best known to them, they had implicated only three of the accused and not others. Further, the victims brother had deposed before the trial court that he had lodged a complaint written in his own hand to the police. However, what was available in the court records was a complaint deduced in writing by a Sub-Inspector of Police attached to Ponmalai Police Station. Thus, it was clear that one complaint had been substituted for another and it is a very serious infirmity, the Bench said. Of all, it is a settled law that acquittal of accused by a trial court adds to the presumption of innocence of the accused. Unless it is shown that a trial court judgement was perverse, it would not be possible to reverse it in an appeal. In this case, the prosecution has not shown any such perversity in the lower court judgement, the Bench said and confirmed the verdict passed by the First Additional District and Sessions Court in Tiruchi on February 19, 2004.

It was by monitoring one of the mobile phones that the gang stole from a house here sometime ago that the police were able to locate them. The men were also identified with the help of the footage from CCTV cameras installed in various parts of the city. Mr. Gopakumar said investigations had shown that the arrested persons were involved in several housebreaking cases, which had taken place in various districts of the State. The men were also part of the gang that was nabbed three days ago from Ochira while attempting to break into a house, but had managed to escape. Notorious burglars from Tamil Nadu, identified as Kalimuthu, Kalaipuli and Kalainjar, were also in that gang, police said. At the time of their arrest on Wednesday, the three men were carrying weapons like swords and iron rods. They were constantly tracked by the anti theft squad of the City Police Commissioner Debesh Kumar Behera, and were arrested by a police team headed by the Assistant Police Commissioner, B. Krishnakumar and circle inspector V. Sugathan.  OPEN",

Mondays voting in 95 constituencies would decide the fate of Chief Minister Narendra Modi, who is facing Shweta Bhatt, wife of suspended IPS official Sanjiv Bhatt, as well as that of several BJP and Congress bigwigs and Ministers. There are as many as 1.98 crore eligible voters. The polling will take place in central and north Gujarat, where as many as 820 candidates, including 95 from the BJP, 92 from the Congress and 84 from Keshubhai Patels Gujarat Parivartan Party, are in the fray. There are 49 women contestants. Analysts say Mr. Modi is seeking to recover the BJPs possible losses in Saurashtra and in tribal regions in South Gujarat by netting votes in central Gujarat. Several of the 52 seats in central Gujarat fall in the tribal region and are conventional Congress strongholds but Mr. Modi launched welfare schemes worth Rs. 14,000 crore in the tribal belt which stretches from Ambaji in the north touching Rajasthan and goes past Dahod on the Madhya Pradesh border up to Saputara, a kissing distance away from Maharashtra. The last day of campaign in central and north Gujarat as well as Kutch saw Mr. Modi and Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi sweating it out, while Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari and a host of others too joined the campaign. Mr. Modi raised the Sir Creek issue again and claimed that as he had predicted, a Pakistani delegation reached New Delhi on Saturday. He demanded that the Centre must clarify whether it would discuss the issue of Sir Creek with Pakistan. He said the Centre had no strength to counter Pakistan which was evident from the fact that a Minister from the neighbouring country Rehman Malik could dare equate the 26/11 Mumbai attacks with the Babri masjid demolition. at Ayodhya. Mr. Rahul Gandhi would not respond to any of it, but targeted the Chief Minister for his politics of anger and said it was time the people of the State switched to the power of love preached by Mahatma Gandhi.

        "content": " Investigation into the kidney racket, which was busted by the Kumbalgod police on December 31, has revealed that during the past two years at least 25 people were lured to either donate or sell their kidneys. Superintendent of Police Anupam Agarwal told presspersons here on Saturday that seven persons had been arrested in connection with the racket, which is widely spread across Ramanagaram district, especially in Magadi taluk. Mr. Agarwal gave their names as K. Mahadeva alias Mahadevaiah (65) of Nayakanahalli in Kanakapura taluk; P. Gopal (40) of Vijayanagar in Ramanagaram; C.D. Srikanth (35) of Magadi; Rajanna (40) of Byatarayanapura, near satellite bus terminal in Bangalore; Manjunath (42) of Magadi; Ranjan (58) of Basaveshwaranagar in Bangalore, and Ananth (50) of Koramangala in Bangalore. The illegal kidney transplants of at least 25 people were carried out at the State-run Victoria Hospital, and at Columbia Asia, Manipal, and Apollo hospitals, Mr. Agarwal said. We will probe the role of these hospitals, he added. While Mahadeva and Gopal are the kingpins, Srikanth  a contract labourer at the Food and Civil Supplies Department at Magadi  was creating the documents needed for kidney transplantation. Ananth was Srikanths assistant at the department, while the others were agents and sub-agents in the racket, Mr. Agarwal said. So far, no inter-State link had been established in the case. However, the matter would be investigated, Mr. Agarwal said. It is a well-operated racket, and scores of people might have illegally sold their organs. Investigation is under way, Mr. Agarwal said. The arrested had confessed to running the racket and selling kidneys of around 25 people, another officer familiar with the investigation, said . Mahadeva was a habitual offender. He was the kingpin in a similar racket that was busted in 2007. He had been evading arrest by violating the bail conditions since then, the officer said. Mahadeva and Gopal used to lure prospective donors from poor families with money and get their organs removed in hospitals. The gang members used to sell kidneys at high prices, the officer said, explaining the modus operandi . The kingpins used to charge between Rs. 5 lakh and Rs. 10 lakh for a kidney. But they gave only Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1 lakh to those who donated the kidneys. All from Magadi Investigations, so far, had showed that all the 25 people who parted with their kidneys belonged to Magadi taluk. Police officials said they would scrutinise the records of patients and beneficiaries in the hospitals. The Kumbalgod police have registered two cases against the accused. Teams to visit tandas Meanwhile, the Ramanagaram district police have decided to dispatch teams to tribal tandas in Magadi taluk for a thorough investigation. We have formed special teams to crack the case and the police teams will go to the tandas on Sunday, Mr. Agarwal added.

        "content": " The police on Saturday arrested five men in connection with the murder of gem dealer and self-styled royal Hari Hara Varma, 68, here on December 24. They identified the accused as M. Jithesh, 33; V. Ajeesh, 27; Rakhil, 24; Jiteshs cousin, Rakesh, 21; and J. Joseph, 20. They hail from lower middle class families in Kannur and Kozhikode districts and were part of a fraternity of Malayali students in Bangalore. Joseph is the son of a planter in Karnataka. All are first offenders with no previous police record. Investigators said that Jitesh, who was occasionally Varmas middleman in shadowy deals involving the transaction of antiques and jewels of questionable value, had plotted the crime to make quick money. Gems of little value They said that Jitesh had, of late, become sceptical of Varmas claim that the gems in his possession were family heirlooms. Jitesh suspected the stones were stolen and reckoned that Varma would not approach the police if he could steal them himself. (The police would subsequently recover the stones from the suspects and find them to be of scarce value). Varma insisted that buyers approaching him prove their solvency, as a rich collector did in November, by paying a non-refundable cash advance of not less than Rs.50,000 just for viewing the gems. He dealt with potential buyers in hotels or rented houses and required them to buy or bring him soft drinks. Sleeping pills The police case was that the suspects, who knew of Varmas habits, met him as buyers at a house he had rented here on December 24 and spiked his drink, and that of his lawyer Haridas, with powdered sleeping pills. When the barbiturates seemed to have no effect on the men, the accused allegedly smothered them with chloroform-soaked cloth. They bound and gagged them, confiscated the gems and their mobile phones and fled the spot. Later, Jitesh anonymously called Haridass son on the lawyers mobile phone and asked him to attend to his father. (Forensic doctors concluded that Varma had died from the combined effects of chloroform smothering and blunt force applied on his throat.) The police team headed by Additional Director General of Police A. Hemachandran; Assistant Commissioner K.E. Baiju; and Sub Inspector C. Mohanan relied, chiefly, on clues provided by Varmas mobile phone to identify the suspects.

        "content": " The Delhi Police on Saturday rebutted allegations of callousness made by the gang-rape victims male friend and said Police Control Room (PCR) vans reached the scene within minutes of the crime and removed the duo to hospital swiftly. In a television interview aired on Friday, the 28-year-old software engineer and only eyewitness to the December 16, 2012 brutal crime alleged that three PCR vans arrived at the scene 30-45 minutes after the PCR call was made and even after reaching the spot the policemen wasted time in deciding on the jurisdiction. As a result, it took more than two hours for them to be taken to the Safdarjung Hospital after they were thrown off the bus. Denying that the PCR vans took 45 minutes to reach the spot, Joint Commissioner (South West) Vivek Gogia said that as per the Global Positioning System records maintained by the  Police Control Room, the first PCR van reached the spot within six minutes of information and another one followed it two minutes later. The PCR vans were not tied down to any police stations jurisdiction. The information regarding the incident was received by a PCR operator at 10.21 p.m. through a phone call received on 100. Two PCR vans  E-47 & Z-54  reached the spot at 10.27 p.m. and 10.29 p.m., said Mr. Gogia, adding that Z-54, which left with the rape victim and her friend at 10.39 p.m., reached Safdarjung Hospital 16 minutes later. He said some time was spent in shifting the two to the van and in arranging for a bedsheet from a neighbouring hotel to cover them. Mr. Gogia, however, did not answer why the victims friend, who himself was injured, had to carry her inside the van instead of the policemen present there doing the job. Responding to the friends question why the two were taken to Safdarjung Hospital instead of to any private hospital nearby, the Joint Commissioner said medico-legal cases were referred to multi-disciplinary government hospitals as better facilities were available there. The youth, who was brutally assaulted inside the bus while trying to save the rape victim, also blamed passersby who, he said, ignored the two lying on the road; several autorickshaws, cars and bikes passing through the stretch did not stop to help them despite the fact that the victim was bleeding profusely.

According to sources in the civic body, the Corporation has not been able to supply Aliyar water to Kurichi and Kuniamuthur as it would like to because of disruption in supply in the recent past. They said that leaks have occurred on at least two or three occasion for one or two days each, forcing the civic body to stop supply because of leaks in the pipeline. Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board supplies around 5 million litres a day Aliyar water by drawing it from the well in Athu Pollachi. It has laid 55 km pipeline for the purpose. The sources said that every time the pipeline leaks, disruption in supply takes place. And residents who were scheduled to get water on the particular day would have to wait for their turn in the next supply cycle, which would invariably be another seven or 10 days. Power crisis Sources in the TWAD Board said that the leaks would soon be a thing of the past as the possibilities would come down drastically once it managed to overcome the power crisis. By the end of the month, the Board would install generator sets for the eight motors in Athu Pollachi, Achipatti and Thirunagar and arrange for feeder supply for the motors at Kinathukadavu and Kurichi. Such an arrangement would mean that power cut did not affect water supply and also serve as a cause for leaks. They said that whenever power cut happens, water flows within the pipeline from opposite directions, given the gradient, and creates pressure at the joints, which give away. They explained it as the hammer effect. With continuous power supply, no such thing would happen and the Board would be not only able to supply water and also increase the quantity. The supply could go up from around 5 mld to 7 mld. This along with another 7 mld Siruvani water would meet the requirements of the residents of Kurichi and Kuniamuthur, they added.  OPEN",

She was referring to the huge death toll (estimated to be 40,000 and 70,000 according to two UN reports) that happened within 120 to 130 days inside the No Fire Zones because of the use of artillery, mortars, rocket launchers and supersonic jets by the Sri Lankan armed forces. Ms. Harrison was speaking at a function at which a Tamil translation of her book was launched. Quoting a World Bank document, she said one lakh persons were missing between 2006 and 2010 and there had to be an explanation on where these people are. Referring to her interviews with 10 persons mentioned in the book and the countless others she had spoken to, Ms. Harrison said most of them were broken and suicidal after seeing the destruction of lives around them. Reading excerpts from the book, Ms. Harrison described how a priest lost his life due to delay in getting treatment and through a journalists account, the final moments of a starving mother who died while breast-feeding her baby. Noted art critic and writer Sadanand Menon, who received the first copy of the translated work at a function here on Saturday, said the Sri Lankan State had to be made accountable for the horrible crimes. As there was a possibility that Sri Lanka might get away with war crimes, Tamils in the mainland must read, circulate and discuss Ms. Harrisons testimony of the final Eelam war through the voices of members of different sections of society who were witness to it, using a dispassionate narrative, he said. Poet Cheran, read from his poetry collection Kaadatru, written during the final stages of the Eelam war, and presented the first copy of the translated book published by Kalachuvadu. Four other poets recited poems on the Eelam struggle and the horrific crimes committed by the Sri Lankan State.

Gouri has found fault with both the State and Central governments for the unprecedented price rise, which she said had made life miserable than ever for the common man. Addressing a press conference at her residence here on Friday, Ms. Gouri said neither government had adopted a pro-active step. The attempts so far were half-hearted with both blaming each other, when they should have ideally sat together and sincerely worked out plans to tackle the issue. Pointing out how she had initiated discussions with other States when she was the Agriculture Minister and similar price rises had affected public life, Ms. Gouri said the public distribution system should first be streamlined and agencies like the Vegetable and Fruits Promotion Council should be revived and pressed into action. Hoarding of essential goods, including onions, was prevalent across the State but official action against this was not yet up to the mark, she felt. Recalling how she as a Minister used to get calls even at midnight from members of the public telling her where and when rice was being hoarded, Ms. Gouri said the public should also be vigilant against such malpractice. The veteran politician also found fault with the Opposition, which included her own party, for sitting idle. Not a single party, including the JSS, have done anything against the price rise. There has been no notable protest from any quarter, she said. Ms. Gouri, who said proper research, discussions and impact assessment on genetically modified seeds should be done before opposing the concept outright, also said that it was up to the Congress to initiate talks with the JSS. The JSS is a small party. We have conveyed our side of the issue and now it is up to the Congress to initiate the talks. Whatever happens, we will take our final decision by March 1, she added. Ms. Gouri also denied reports that she was planning to return to the CPI(M). My party, which has a membership of one lakh, stood by me when I left the CPI(M).

Mr. Sethi on Thursday toured the affected areas. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who convened a meeting of Home Minister Shanti Dhariwal, the Chief Secretary, the Director General of Police and other senior officers in the evening here, announced the suspension of nine officials from the Excise and the police departments after getting preliminary reports. The suspended include Jainarain Meghwal, Excise Officer (Prevention), Lala Jetu, Assistant Director, Excise (Prevention Squad), Jodhpur West, and Rajbir Singh, Circle Inspector, Basni police station. Mr. Gehlot also directed Excise Minister Rajendra Pareek to visit the area. The reports reaching here said the victims included one woman, Virju Devi of Sangaria Phanta, a downtown Jodhpur suburb. There are 13 persons admitted to the MDM Hospital in the city. Three of them are in the intensive care unit. The victims included one person each from Ballia (Uttar Pradesh), Bihar and West Bengal. Most of the victims are said to be from Sangaria Phanta and the neighbouring villages of Khejrali, Sangasani, Pithawas, Rathukadia and settlements near to the Basni industrial area. Some of them were workers in the factories while a few were engaged in the construction of a building for the proposed AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences). Though there were unconfirmed reports of more deaths in the rural areas, Jodhpur Collector Siddharth Mahajan said the deaths were not authenticated as the post mortem of the said bodies were not carried out. We will investigate further to verify the truth of the claims, he said. BJP State president Arun Chaturvedi, who toured the affected areas during the day along with former Jodhpur MP Jaswant Vishnoi, blamed the Government for its gross negligence. In the first two days of the tragedy the Government failed to take quick action. No Minister visited the affected places even when it is the city of the Chief Minister, Mr. Chaturvedi said.  OPEN",

        "content": " In a televised press interaction on Wednesday in Kirandul, S.R.P. Kalluri, Senior Superintendent of Police, Dantewada, accused international humanitarian organisations Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) of helping the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) and promised to investigate both agencies. Formed in 2004, the CPI (Maoist) is a guerilla organisation committed to overthrowing the Union government through an armed revolution. In footage screened by local cable channels, Mr. Kalluri claimed that MSF and the ICRC were providing Maoists with medical prescriptions and treating Naxalites injured in police ambushes. They come in the name of the poor [but] help the Naxalites, Mr. Kalluri said. According to a transcript provided by a local television channel, he also said he had alerted the State government. However, Director-General of Police Vishwa Ranjan said no such investigation was under way. The ICRC is still in the process of signing an agreement with the government to operate in Chhattisgarh, he said. We are not investigating either organisation for supporting the Maoists, he said, attributing Mr. Kalluri's comments to confusion among the local press. Representatives of both organisations expressed surprise and dismay at Mr. Kalluri's accusations. These allegations, as I understand them, are not true. MSF has worked in Chhattisgarh for quite some time. We are very transparent, and provide medical care to the entire population, said Martin Sloot, who heads the MSF mission in India. We are not a political organisation, we are medical organisation. We believe in the principles of impartiality and neutrality, and that healthcare is a right, Mr. Sloot said, adding that MSF did not allow armed people into its health centres. MSF, or Doctors without Borders, now runs a hospital and mother-and-child healthcare centre in Bijapur district and mobile clinics in Dantewada district. Set up in 1971, MSF operates in conflict zones across the world and won the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize for its role in providing healthcare in crisis situations. In 2006, the Collector of Dantewada levelled similar charges against MSF, but the State government allowed the organisation to continue its work in the region. I am surprised by the comments, said Yahia Alibi, Deputy Regional Head of the ICRC. We do not operate in Dantewada, but are running one primary health centre in Kutru, Bijapur, with the full support of the local administration and the police. Based in Geneva, Switzerland, the ICRC is one of the oldest and best known humanitarian institutions in the world and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1917, 1944 and 1963 for its work in international and internal armed conflict. This is the second major controversy to emerge in the aftermath of one of Mr. Kalluri's press conferences. On July 11 last year, he accused a journalism student, Lingaram Kodopi, of being a member of the Central Committee of the CPI (Maoist). In an emotional press conference held in Delhi, Mr. Kodopi denied the charge and said he had been illegally incarcerated by the police in the past and was finally released on the directions of the Bilaspur High Court. A recent article published in Sanhati.com quotes Mr. Kodopi's aunt, Soni Sori, as saying that Mr. Kalluri had arrested her husband on trumped-up charges and allegedly threatened to arrest her unless she handed over her nephew to the police. Mr. Kalluri was not available for comment.  OPEN",

The agitators demanded a ban on fascist organisations such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Abhinav Bharat. These organisations are the root cause of hatred and enmity between people in the nation, a press release stated. Propaganda' They alleged by carrying out a propaganda through the media, investigators had built a perception that Muslims were responsible for terrorism. In light of Swami Aseemanand's confession of his involvement in the Malegaon 2006 blast, they demanded bail for the nine accused arrested in the case. If there is a blast in a masjid and Muslims are killed, even a common man will tell you that it cannot be the job of a Muslim person. Investigating agencies have deliberately twisted investigations and trapped Muslim youths. Strict inquiry and action is needed against the RSS and erring investigators. A blast is a blot on the nation, Malegaon's Maulana Azhari, who was at the rally, told The Hindu. The other demands of the protesters were unconditional release of Muslim youths who are still behind bars in connection with the Mecca Masjid, Ajmer Sharif, and Samjhauta Express blasts, and impartial investigation into the murder of Sunil Joshi, RSS pracharak who was suspected to be working under Swami Aseemanand.

        "content": " G.N. Nagaraj, State secretariat member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), while expressing concern over the rising incidence of atrocities on women, including rape, across the State, urged the Home Department to set up a task force in the Police Department to accelerate the process of investigation of such cases and bringing the guilty to book. He demanded that fast-track courts, meant exclusively to deal with cases pertaining to atrocities on women, be set up. Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, Mr. Nagarj said that although several cases of atrocities on women, including the rape of a mentally challenged girl, had been reported in the State, it was unfortunate that cases were not being registered properly and no proper investigation was being carried out. To ensure that the guilty get punished, the Home Department should form a task force to deal with such cases and accelerate the process of investigation. In addition, Fast track courts should be set up to deal with such cases, he said. Mr. Nagaraj took exception to the reported statement of Mohan Bhagwat, chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh that instances of rape were restricted to urban India and not Bharat or rural India, and said that women in rural areas were living in a suffocating atmosphere and facing atrocities daily. Protest Mr. Nagaraj said that the CPI(M) would be staging a protest all over the State on January 11 and urge the government to initiate steps to curb atrocities on women. The CPI (M) had urged the government to ban pankti bheda and made snana prevalent in temples and religious institutions in the State to put an end to caste system. The party would organise district-level conventions, along with like-minded progressive organisations, to create an awareness among the people about the need to ban such practices, Mr. Nagaraj said. A signature campaign would be launched to prevail upon the Union government to extend food security to all citizens by arranging to supply foodgrains through public distribution system, which would help check the rising prices of essential commodities, he said.

Addressing presspersons here on Saturday, vice-president of the State unit of the sangha Chamarasa Malipatil said farmers in the State were happy about the verdict that permitted the State to store water in the Alamatti Balancing Reservoir up to 524.26 m, but were disappointed about the allocation of surplus water in Scheme B. The State should have got a share of 50 per cent, but the Justice Brijesh Kumar tribunal had allotted 177 tmcft as the share of Karnataka. A cut in water allocation would harm the interest of farmers in the State, Mr. Malipatil said and urged the Government to appeal against this. The KRRS would discuss the issue at its State committee meeting on January 6 in Bangalore. Later, a delegation would meet Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa and Minister for Water Resources Basavaraj Bommai to discuss the matter, the KRRS vice-president said. Mr. Malipatil said the permission to raise the height of the Alamatti Dam was a victory for the sangha, which in 1995 had organised a karseva to erect the crest gates of the dam. He criticised successive governments for neglecting pending irrigation projects in the Krishna basin, including the second phase extension of the Narayanapura Right Bank Canal under the Upper Krishna Project, the Nandawadagi Lift Irrigation Scheme and the Bolmandoddi Lift Irrigation Scheme. Of the 734 tmcft of water allocated to Karnataka by the Bachawat Tribunal, so far the State has been able to utilise less than 500 tmcft. Along with the unutilised share of more than 200 tmcft in the Scheme A and another 177 tmcft allocated by the Justice Brijesh Kumar tribunal, the State has to make arrangements to utilise nearly 400 tmcft of water in the next 50 years. He urged the State to allocate necessary funds and make efforts to implement all pending irrigation projects.

The accused had demanded Rs.15 lakh in ransom. Dharam Singh, a resident of Jhilmil Colony, lodged a compliant to the police on December 15 saying that his 14-year-old son, Vikas alias Golu, had gone missing from outside his house. Subsequently, a kidnapping case was registered at the Vivek Vihar Police Station. On December 23, a man called up the complainant and demanded Rs.15 lakh for the safe release of his son. It was followed by a series of ransom calls made from several public call offices in Ghaziabad and Delhi. Further investigation revealed that the complainant had lost money to one Anil Sharma alias Shetty recently in gambling, but had not paid him. The police mounted surveillance on Shetty and found his activities to be suspicious. Shetty along with his two accomplices, Manish (23) and Nikhil (18), was arrested in Karawal Nagar on Saturday. During interrogation, Shetty purportedly confessed to having kidnapped the boy along with his two accomplices and having murdered him the same day. Shetty earlier worked at the Reserve Bank of India as a class IV employee on temporary basis and recently lost his job, the police said.   OPEN",

Mr. Gupta said patrolling will be intensified between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. to check crimes like carjacking. We have found that 52 per cent of the crimes committed between 4 p.m. and midnight are street crimes like snatching, whereas carjacking is committed mostly between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m., he said. Mr. Gupta said more vehicles will be procured by the Police Control Room. A proposal for Hyundai Accent cars has been sent in this regard for consideration, he added. The police also plan to extend the ongoing drive against lane violations from the existing 15 road corridors to 20 stretches. People are now adhering to lane driving and it is an encouraging sign. We are now starting a drive to ensure that trucks are not parked on roads, he said, adding that the trucks parked on the roads could also be impounded.  OPEN",

Gupta has given a go ahead for its constitution by approving the posting of officers. The newly-created unit will probe all the cases registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The Vigilance wing was earlier empowered only to conduct enquiries into charges of misconduct, malpractices, negligence and corruption against policemen and forward recommendations for actions. The new anti-corruption unit, which is functioning under the direct supervision of the Joint Commissioner of Police (Vigilance), has been empowered to conduct preliminary enquiries, register cases at the respective police stations and carry out investigations, searches, seizures and arrests. The Police Commissioner has issued orders for posting an Assistant Commissioner of Police, three inspectors and three sub-inspectors to the unit. The ACP, an inspector and two sub-inspectors have already reported and the others are expected to join soon. While in the Central Bureau of Investigation, an inspector is empowered to investigate corruption cases, in States only an ACP is authorised to conduct the probe. Hence, the Vigilance wing has requested the Delhi Government to empower inspector-level officers for the job. It has also urged the Government to authorise the designated court for the Anti-Corruption Branch for all the legal processes undertaken by the unit for the purpose of investigation. This will help the unit as the cases, though registered at different police stations, will go to the same court. The corruption cases that were earlier being investigated by the Crime Branch have now been transferred to the newly-created unit. The emphasis will now be on taking up a few cases effectively with the objective of sending across a strong message that corruption in the force will not be tolerated, said Joint Commissioner of Police (Vigilance) N. Dilip Kumar. The circular for creating the unit was issued by former Police Commissioner Y. S. Dadwal last year, but no officers were posted to it then. It has now become functional with the incumbent Police Chief issuing the posting orders. From now on, all the cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act against Delhi Police personnel and officers will be handled by the unit. Aimed at curbing corruption in police   OPEN",

Failing which the Municipality will seal them on January 1, said Municipal Commissioner S. Sezhiyan. Residents of Nallipalayam are bearing the strong foul smell emanating from these mills for a long time. Dry fish meal (about 300 tonnes a day) is one of the feeds for the poultry farms in the district. It is brought from various parts of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other states, dried, processed, and mixed with other ingredients for use as feed. Grinding dried fish resulted in increase in houseflies at a radius of more than 1 km. The situation worsened when mills brought decayed fish and fish wastes (without drying) and dry them near the mills, says R. Kumaravel, a resident of Nallipalayam. People residing far away from Nallipalayam too said that they too were victims of these mills. Waste water from trucks carrying fish gets spilt all the way to the mill as the fish is not properly packed. Nobody can clean the water all along the road and there is nothing we are able to do about the smell even after the water gets dried. It becomes worse when it rain, they said. It is unimaginable how people live under such unhygienic conditions, said Mr. Sezhiyan after inspecting localities near the fish processing mills. We have served notices on these mills on November 23, asking them to close down operations. The process of identifying more such mills and drying godowns is underway. Appropriate action will be initiated against them, he said. The move to close down these units, however, has been opposed by poultry farmers, who strongly felt that an alternative solution has to be worked out to help small poultry farms. Small mills dont own feed manufacturing units and closing down the fish mills will result in acute feed shortage. These mills were established when the poultry industry was established in this district. They should be directed to bring dried fish and process it here or an area should be earmarked for establishing these mills at a safe distance from residential localities, said poultry farmers.

Taking up the case filed by C. Anantha Raj (30) of Equal Right, a non-governmental organisation based here, for hearing on Friday, a Division Bench of Justice M. Jaichandren and Justice T. Raja directed a government counsel to take notice on behalf of Health and Family Welfare Department. They also directed the Collector to file a report by January 7 with regard to the facilities available in the hospital. Lacks all basic amenities According to the petitioner, the news item pointed out that the Thoppur hospital, inaugurated by former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj in 1960, virtually lacked all basic amenities required for treating the patients. It did not even have a laboratory to test blood samples of those afflicted with tuberculosis, cholera, chickenpox, mumps and measles and patients had to travel about 18 kilometres for undergoing the test. Stating that he made a personal visit to the hospital after having read the news item, the petitioner said that he found the institution in dire straits despite possessing 100 acres of land. Unsafe at night The huge campus was not even lit properly making it unsafe at night. It did not have alternative arrangements for power supply during the regular load shedding every day. The cholera ward was very untidy and unhygienic making the patients prone to mosquito bites. The hospitals kitchen was functioning from a dilapidated building and the toilets too were very badly maintained. Though it had a sanctioned strength of 90 staff, only 60 were working in the hospital for the past several years, the petitioner added. Further pointing out that he had made detailed representations in this regard to the authorities concerned, the petitioner sought for a direction to the State to provide all amenities including an ambulance, equipments required for blood test and a power generator at the hospital. He also wanted the court to order filling up of vacancies and renovation of kitchen besides finding a solution to the drainage problem.  OPEN",

In addition to fetching a good price, either as a whole or when broken down into components, in the grey market, a car is also optimum for a fast getaway. It was perhaps these factors that led S. Venketaraman to take up the stealing of SUVs as a habit. The notorious car-thief, who has over a dozen cases registered against him, was again nabbed on Sunday as he attempted to unlock a Tata Sumo on West Matha Street in Royapuram in north Chennai. The vehicle belonged to S. Rajasekar, a manager in a private firm in Kodambakkam, who was in for a rude shock when he stepped out of his house. Residents join chase He alerted his neighbours and together, they chased and nabbed the 29-year-old and then, alerted the Royapuram police. A couple of residents also beat up Venketaraman before the police reached the spot. A case of attempted theft under section 379 of IPC was filed by the Royapuram police. It carries a maximum imprisonment of three years. He was sent to the central prison at Puzhal Police officers said Venketaraman was a resident of Vishakhapatnam and a school drop-out who moved to Chennai in 2009 to make a living. After doing a series of odd jobs, he began working as a cleaner in a hotel in Kodambakkam. According to police, it was there that he learned driving and also got in touch with car mechanics, who used to come to the hotel regularly. Over time, he became adept at the mechanics of cars. As the job of a cleaner fetched little money, he began stealing cars. He used to help car owners open the doors of their vehicles when they lost their keys. This helped him gain confidence. He also got in touch with some traders who bought car components, said a police officer. His first successful target was a Tata Sumo, which he stole from Koillidam near Srikali in southern Tamil Nadu, in 2009. He then set out on a spree of robberies across the State focussing on SUVs, including one at Tirutani in Tiruvallur district near Chennai in 2010. The latest car he stolen was a Toyota Innova in front of a house at Royapettah in December, 2012. He was subsequently nabbed by the police.

A case against him has been registered under Sections 376, 450 and 506 for rape, house trespass to commit crime and criminal intimidation. Dharmendrakumar Choudhary (22), who hails from Hatras in Uttar Pradesh, has been accused of raping the 29-year-old woman on the night of December 9. Police inspector Bhausaheb Andhlakar told The Hindu that the victim recognised the voice of the accused which led to the arrest. The police had kept a close watch on Choudhary since his behaviour had been suspicious from the day of the rape. According to Mr. Andhalkar, the accused was questioned by the police after the incident. A case under section 309 of the IPC has been registered against him. However, the police are yet to receive the results of the DNA samples. An official statement from Amby Valley said: The person arrested by police is an outsourced employee at Amby Valley security.

        "content": " The involvement of juvenile delinquents or youngsters under 18 years of age is growing at an alarming pace. What is worse, the laws in place are insufficient to deal with the situation. This has been a reason for growing resentment and even frustration in civil society. During 2011, juveniles were involved in 37 murders, 24 attempt to murders, 47 rapes and 30 cases of kidnapping and abduction in the Capital. Clearly it is not only a matter of innocence lost but reflects a dangerous trend. As per the Crime in India 2011 report of the National Crime Records Bureau, at an all-India level too the registered crime involving juveniles has increased from 16,509 in 2001 to 25,125 in 2011 and in respect of the percentage of total cognizable offence too their involvement has increased from 0.9 per cent to 1.1 per cent during this period. The tendency of children to take to crime has also increased and in 2011 as many as 2.1 per cent crime was committed by children as against 1.6 per cent a decade ago. While the involvement of girls in juvenile crimes involving both Indian Penal Code sections and Special and Local Laws (SLL) has decreased from 6.9 per cent to 5.8 per cent, the increased involvement of boys is a cause of concern; in particular when their involvement in registered sex crimes like rape has increased sharply from 399 to 858 cases in the past decade. What is also worrisome is that due to increased information flow through print, electronic and social media, a word has spread that those under 18 are not tried under the normal laws and can literally get away with murder. According to Amod Kanth, founder of non-government organisation Prayas, which runs several observation and care homes for children, it has come to light through recent scrutiny of records that over 60-65 per cent of crimes by juveniles are committed by those between 15 and 18 years of age. That is an issue. But we need to connect to them. Aftercare programmes are also important. When children are released from Homes, there is a need to maintain a watch on them for rehabilitation and reformation. Mr. Kanth said it has come to light that in most cases of recidivism or repeat offences the juvenile offenders do not appear to be taking advantage of the age factor. They often go back to crime simply because they return to the same social set-up. As per NCRB data, of the 942 juveniles booked for IPC and SLL offences in 2011, as many as 205 were old delinquents or repeat offenders. The statistics confirm that economic factors play a major role in the involvement of these children in crime. The economic classification of these children had revealed that only 49 or about 5 per cent of them came from families with an annual family income of over Rs.1 lakh. Similarly, most of the children involved in crimes in Delhi were found to be either illiterate (over 20 per cent) and only 10 per cent had done matriculation or higher studies. Nearly 80 per cent of all these delinquents were found to be staying with their parents; about 13 per cent with guardians; while the rest 7 per cent were homeless. Mr. Kanth, who retired as Director General of Police, insists that often the police are also to blame for not treating crime committed by juveniles properly. They should register cases to know if the offenders have been misbehaving in the past, have been involved in rape and murder cases, have a history of sexual truancy. How will they reform and take corrective measures without even registering serious offences, he said. While FIRs cannot be registered against children, Mr. Kanth said, Daily diary entries can be maintained as per law. He added: I once wrote to a former Delhi Police Commissioner that gangs of children, which could be numbering in thousands, may be there. This is a serious problem. Citing the case of Sonu, who was involved in a number of burgle and burn cases in South Delhi, Mr. Kanth said it has come to his notice that at one point there were over 20 members in his gang. Almost all those involved in such burglaries had adopted the strategy to destroy evidence. In India, he said, about 1.5 to 2 per cent of the total crimes are committed by juveniles while the population of children below 18 years is 42 per cent of the total population. So in proportion the crime committed by others is much more. But this is going to be a problem in future as the incidence of such crime is growing. This is disturbing the societal equilibrium. However, with proper measures, we can deal with juvenile crime. As for solution to the problem, he said, in Delhi there would be about 500 juvenile delinquents. They are spread over various police stations and so in each police station a list of four or five such children can be drawn up to identify and interact with them on a regular basis so that they do not return to crime, Mr. Kanth suggested.

        "content": " As the demands for womens safety become more forceful, a father who lost his 19-year-old son to ragging has drawn attention to the fact that ragging has a sexual connotation as well and that a significant number of ragged students were also sexual abused. There have been a significant number of cases where rape has been guised as ragging, said Rajendra Kachroo, whose son Aman lost his life after being mercilessly beaten up by his seniors while being ragged at a Medical College in Himachal Pradesh four years ago. Mr. Kachroo, who runs an anti-ragging helpline, feels let down by the governments half- hearted contribution to anti-ragging activities and says colleges have done little to connect with students. Recently, I received a call from a father who said his son had been sexually abused by his seniors at a college, but was so shaken up that he even refused to register a complaint. And this is not an isolated case. There are several such instances where girls and even boys are sexually abused, he told The Hindu . Despite Supreme Court guidelines and a national outcry against ragging that has claimed the lives of many and left a sizeable number physically and mentally affected, educational institutions and the government have been slipshod in tackling the menace, claimed Mr. Kachroo. There is insensitivity and disconnect on the part of the college authorities as far as students welfare is concerned. There is a Dean of Students Welfare in most institutions, but there is little involvement in the welfare of the students. A teachers role does not end with academics alone. A case in point is this recent case of ragging involving a student of the School of Planning and Architecture in Delhi, the college is on record, claiming they did not know what happened to their own student. Accusing colleges and institutions of not adhering to the laid down guidelines against ragging, Mr. Kachroo said there have been instances when his anti ragging helpline has had to send repeated reminders to the authorities to take action. As soon as the helpline receives a complaint we immediately connect with the college concerned and pass on the message, some colleges have been quick to take action, but there are many that dont do so, despite our repeated reminders. We can push only to a certain point, he said. Mr. Kachroo is not too happy with the way the helpline is run as well. He says limited funds from the government for the project have meant a limit on how much can be spent on running the call centre. Consequently, the call centre cannot employ those who are more suited for the job. There is a problem of quality; while we have sophisticated software and an adequate number of operators to take down and record the complaints, the operators are not entirely equipped for the job that requires sensitivity and seriousness. The call centre that has been in service for the past seven months has registered more than 350 calls this past year alone. Though the numbers have come down from the previous years, there are gaps in the way the campaign is run. Colleges and the University Grants Commission need to do more to popularise anti- ragging helpline [1800-180-5522] and to tackle the complaints. The rule says all colleges must report complaints of ragging within 24 hours to the police, unless they are minor problems, he pointed out. Mr. Kachroo is also intensifying efforts to get students to file affidavits as part of the anti-ragging prevention plan. As per the policy, students and their parents have to file an affidavit before the student is registered for the programme. The helpline has collected about 1.5 lakh signatures already, but are targeting a million by June next year. Urging colleges and the administration to act tough against ragging, Mr. Kachroo said: Ragging is a betrayal of trust. When parents leave their children in colleges and hostels, they do so with a sense of security that their child will be looked after. They are given to believe that the staff and the administration will be responsible for the childs welfare. But the trust of these parents is betrayed when their children are ragged. Kachroo feels institutions, government have been slipshod in tackling the menace of raggingAt times, his helpline has had to send repeated reminders to institutions to take action Kachroo feels institutions, government have been slipshod in tackling the menace of ragging At times, his helpline has had to send repeated reminders to institutions to take action  OPEN",

Lakshmamma, who lived alone after being separated from her husband Krishnamurthy, was smothered to death and her home looted. The Rajagopalanagar police, following her relatives' complaint, had arrested Krishnamurthy, a sub-inspector in the Excise Department, and son Girish. However, the Organised Crime Wing officials of Central Crime Branch (CCB) arrested Manjunath alias Loose Manja (20), Mallikarjun alias Malli (20) of Javagal in Arasikere, Kartik alias Shetty (20) of Chitradurga, Ravi Kiran alias Ravi (20) of Kottigepalya, Arjun (20) of Sunkadakatte, Imran Pasha alias Imran (19) of Yelahanka and Suleiman (22) of Yelahanka New Town. Kartik had an electronic goods servicing shop at the ground floor in the building where Lakshmamma lived and hatched a plot to rob her, the CCB told The Hindu. The seven men barged into her house and when they faced strong resistance from her, they killed her, a CCB officer said. Manjunatha, who lives near Shivananda Circle, runs two gangs and has been committing robberies, he added. The other gang The arrested men have confessed, the police said. The police arrested members of his other gang, not involved in the murder, and seized weapons from them.

        "content": " Union Minister for Rural Development Jairam Ramesh took an indirect dig at the State Government for not making available individual sanitary latrines or, at least, community toilets in spite of its tall claims on women empowerment. Mr. Jairam recalled his experience in Anantapur district recently where he accompanied Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to interact with self help groups. Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy and Minister N. Raghuveera Reddy made several claims on women empowerment including provision of basic amenities to them. But when asked for their views, seven out of 10 women in the gathering said they had no toilets and so they defecate in the open. This is the state of affairs in spite of the fact that a majority of these women are enrolled in the self help groups for over five years, he said. Mr. Jairam Ramesh was addressing the participants at the valedictory of a national conference on community based approaches for inclusive growth here on Saturday. The Minister announced the Centres decision to extend loans at seven per cent interest to SHGs from April 1 next year bringing them on a par with the farmers. The interest rate would be further reduced to 4 per cent in 150 districts selected on the basis of parameters like Dalit and population of tribal people and incidence of naxalites. In addition, the Centres decision to implement direct benefit transfer scheme would come in handy for the SHG women who could act as franchisees in reaching out the amounts to targeted beneficiaries. This is not a scheme where money is deposited in the accounts. It involves cash transfer and SHG women can utilise their network as banking correspondents for effective delivery of cash at the door steps, of course, charging some commission from the Government, he said. The State had registered 1,500 SHG women as franchisees to operate post office accounts and the model could be replicated in the banks too in the coming days. The Minister explained that the salient feature of the national rural livelihood mission project was to reach out to the grass roots for which the elected local bodies and the SHG groups formed two main pillars. The women, on their part, should make sure they did not confine themselves to financial issues and looked beyond to address social aspects like women trafficking, sanitation and manual scavenging still prevalent in some parts, he added.

A Bench comprising judicial member K. Elango and administrative member R. Satapathy gave the interim order on an original application filed by G. Vinoth, who alleged that the authorities had arbitrarily altered the norms concerning educational qualification and upper age limit all of a sudden. Mr. Vinoth said persons like him were affected by the sudden increase in the qualification for selection process. The authorities had increased the academic qualification from SSLC pass to higher secondary pass for the selection process. Besides, authorities have brought down the maximum age limit for selection to 22, while the original age limit was a minimum of 18 years to maximum of 27 years. The altered norms, however, were not made applicable to home guards, who were given 25 per cent of the available vacancies, he said. Moreover, the total reserved vacancies amounted to 64 per cent, which he said was against the ruling of the Supreme Court in the Indira Sawhney case.

Our voice has been repeatedly overshadowed by bureaucratic processes, said Javed Abidi, convener, DRG. While the rest of the nation will be soaked in joy and preparing to usher in the New Year, disabled people face an agonising situation. He explains that there are four laws which affect the lives of disabled people in the country - Disability Rights Act, Mental Disability Act, Rehabilitation Council of India Act and the National Trust Act. After repeated protests and demonstrations, the government finally acceded to draft a new law to replace the archaic and charity-ridden Disability Rights Act, enacted in 1995. A 27-member committee was formed on April 30, 2010, and was given a four month deadline to prepare a draft. According to Mr.Abidi, the committee did not meet even once for the first 40 days. After two extensions, the deadline was fixed as December 31, but still nothing has happened, said Mr.Abidi. One of the seven differently-abled members of the committee, Rajiv Rajan, who has resigned in protest, said Even the definition of disability must be relooked. The definition must move beyond a health certificate to one that covers social aspects such as access and opportunities.   OPEN",

Speaking to The Hindu here on Friday, Forest Veterinarian N.S.Manoharan said that on December 9 the calf had accidentally fallen in its enclosure. Since it had landed in an awkward position with its chest hitting the floor, it could not raise itself up. Examination With the animal not responding to treatment provided immediately by some local doctors, a team of veterinarians including experts from the Animal Husbandry Department, the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University and Kerala had thoroughly examined it on Wednesday. Its right foreleg was swollen due to a shoulder joint injury and it was in considerable pain. Stating that a cradle has been formed to help it lie down in a comfortable position, he said that arrangements have also been made to give it physiotherapy and support therapy. Efforts are also being made to take a mobile X-Ray unit to Theppakadu. To a query, Dr.Manoharan said that the injuries were not life threatening. Its condition is being monitored round the clock. On May 22, 2010, the abandoned calf had been found at Sirumugai. With efforts to re-unite it with its herd or mother going in vain, it was shifted to the MTR three days later. It had been extremely weak and debilitated due to wounds. Since then it had been falling ill on and off.  OPEN",

        "content": " Some economists are of the view that post-liberalisation more inequalities have resulted in an already unequal country leading to more conflict mostly because of the growing polarisation of consuming power. On the other hand, there will be others who will differ. All this and more economic theories and papers were under discussion at a two-day conference on Indias Economy: A longer and broader view which opened here on Friday. Overall inequality The afternoon session was on Polarisation, inequality and growth: The Indian experience, presented by Dr. Sripad Motiram. He showcased different literatures on surveys undertaken by economists on polarisation in wealth, consuming power and class. His paper had relied heavily on the National Sample Survey data and he spoke of how more and more very rich people failed to take part in the surveys. He said the polarisation of the poor in consuming goods had been on the decline ever since the 1990s which added to conflict and overall inequality. Prof. Indira Rajaraman, also on the board of directors in the Reserve Bank, said the surveys were conducted by people in the developed world which would not find resonance in India as there were several other polarisations than just of consumer goods. The polarisation when it came to access to public goods like roads, transport and other civic amenities posed a bigger problem than just the inequalities felt at being able to consume less. The polarisation with regard to job risks and asset usurpation were also contributing factors that added to conflict. The Maoist corridor was born out of asset usurpation like land acquisition, she said. More conflicts She added that in the 1980s when consumption was less polarised there were more conflicts compared to the 1990s when consumption became increasingly polarised but access to public services became more or less equal. She also added that in the villages, more households were starting to become less fearful that their consumption levels could decrease. In the villages, people mostly invest in goods that can be sold or pawned in case of an emergency. Many would choose to construct mud walls for their homes and not invest heavily in a brick wall, because a brick wall is not something that you can trade in. However this is increasingly on the decline and many households are investing in proper brick homes. There is less fear of their consumption levels decreasing, she said. The conference is on till Saturday at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library. It has been organised in collaboration with Prof. Pulapre Balakrishnan. Euphoria waning The idea behind the conference is to discuss the issues behind the fact that in the two decades since the economic reforms launched in 1991, the immediate euphoria and the five-year run of very high growth appears to be waning. The ongoing conference is intended to take a longer and broader view of the future of the Indian economy focusing on aspects of economic movement other than the mostly liberalising reforms which dominate the governments policy agenda currently.

According to a recently conducted need assessment study Drug using street children, done by non-government organisation Sharan Society for Services to Urban Poor released on Friday, drug-dependent street children often get pushed into becoming criminals. It said that girl children on the street get sexually exploited and are forced into sex work and drug use with no future option but to become commercial sex workers with drug dependence. The study aimed at finding out about the condition of street children in Delhi looked at their demographics, living status, drug abuse habits and kind of work done by them. Non-government organisation Family Health International country director Dr. Bitra George said: Sample population for the study were children between 6-16 years; and almost 57 per cent of them lived on pavements/under bridges, 30 per cent stayed in shelter/care homes and rehabilitation centres and few with their families. During the study we found that children used drugs for numbing effect to cope with the sexual and physical exploitation and the abuse that they have to face to stay on the streets. Another disturbing factor that was found as part of the study was that 40 per cent of the children noted that they faced harassment by different agencies and 91 per cent of them claimed that this was by the police, 4.5 per cent by local goonads and 4.5 per cent from other agencies. Substance abuse and drug use was also found to be rampant with 93 per cent of the interviewed children stating that they were currently using drugs. As per the study, 41.3 per cent children claimed that they were using nail polish/ whitener/solvent, 29 per cent used tobacco with other substances, 11 per cent children used charas and 1.6 per cent used brown sugar. Sixteen per cent children said they were treated for drug/substance abuse while 72 per cent claimed that they had undergone treatment in rehabilitation centre. Children staying with their parents also noted that they managed to earn up to Rs. 30 per day to buy solvents which would last them for at least two days. Also, a few children who were treated for drug use were found to be going back to the streets and drugs again.  OPEN",

        "content": " Expressing concern over heightened levels of violence against political workers in West Bengal, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the number of killings was alarming and pointed to a virtual collapse of law and order in parts of the State. In his letter of December 30, 2010 to West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, a copy of which was released on Friday, the Home Minister said that he had used the word harmad' (hired killers) in an earlier letter as it was extensively used in the media, but would use any other word to describe armed cadres that Mr. Bhattacharjee would care to suggest. Mr. Bhattacharjee had taken strong exception to the use of the nasty word in Mr. Chidambaram's letter last week. Mr. Chidambaram agreed with Mr. Bhattacharjee that it was not a happy situation considering the level of violence in the State. He had on Thursday sent two letters to Mr. Bhattacharjee, in reply to the Chief Minister's December 28 communication. Both letters were faxed as well as sent by speed post. While you have put the number of Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadres killed and injured at 69 and 723 respectively, according to our information they are 65 and 773 respectively. The figures are not very different. In fact, there is broad agreement on the numbers killed and injured. If our numbers are broadly correct in the case of CPI(M) cadres killed and injured, there is no reason to doubt our numbers regarding Trinamool Congress and Congress cadres killed and injured. These numbers have been gathered in [a uniform] manner and from the same sources. Taken together, the numbers are alarming and that is why I said that they point to a virtual collapse of law and order in parts of West Bengal, Mr. Chidambaram said in the letter. Agreeing with the Chief Minister's view that the CPI (Maoist) had a significant presence in three districts of West Bengal and that the challenge was containing them both administratively and politically, he pointed out that it was towards this end that the Centre provided substantial support by deploying Central forces upon request. The question that remains unanswered in your letter is: if armed cadres continue to take upon themselves the duties of maintaining law and order, what is the role of the security forces, especially of the Central paramilitary forces that have been deployed at the request of the State government, he said. In the second letter, Mr. Chidambaram clarified his use of the word harmad' to describe the armed cadres. I do not think that the word is per se offensive but, should you suggest another word or phrase to describe the armed cadres referred to in my letter, I shall be happy to use that word or phrase, he said. Both of us should focus on the substance of my letter and not be distracted by extraneous matters, Mr. Chidambaram said. He also invited Mr. Bhattacharjee to the capital for a frank discussion on this extremely sensitive issue, to agree upon the way forward, indicating his availability from January 3 to January 7, 2011.

The letter was written on Friday and made available to the media at the State Secretariat. I wanted not to open all our correspondences before the media, but to discuss with you the problems when I meet you in Delhi. But as you have already released the correspondence between us to the media, I feel compelled to write further on the issues raised by you, the Chief Minister said. He told reporters later that Friday's letter was being released as the earlier correspondences had been made public. Mr. Chidambaram had written two further letters on Thursday to which the Chief Minister had responded right away. Harmad' Mr. Bhattacharjee addressed in the letter Mr. Chidambaram's response to his objection to the latter's use of the word harmad'  which he had found nasty'  to describe party workers. You have proposed to replace it with any better word that I may suggest. I am sorry that I cannot offer you any such word since I am unable to accept your attitude towards Left-Front workers in our State, [as is] your observation regarding failure of law and order in certain areas, the Chief Minister said in his letter.

These gangs would steal card data, and through middlemen, sell cloned cards to offenders here, who would use them for illegal transactions, resulting in losses for the original cardholder. But of late, there have numerous reports of the card data of local persons being stolen. The Hyderabad Central Crime Station Cyber Crime wing recently cracked one such case, bringing to light an interesting modus operandi. The prime accused, a bank BPO staffer, colluded with two employees of a petrol bunk and gave them a skimmer  a gadget the size of a mobile phone. When a customers card is swiped at the bunk, the electronic code data of the card is copied by the skimmer. The data is then retrieved and used to create a duplicate card. This indicates that not just international criminals, but locals too indulge in cloning cards, points out an investigator. The new modus operandi is posing a fresh challenge to police, who however say their role is limited to preventing such frauds. The primary source for stealing card data is the banks wing in-charge of credit/debit cards. Executives having access to the customers database and hackers have been found to be the accused in some cases. Unsuspecting cardholders are the next source from where the data is fraudulently obtained. This happens mostly when the customer presents his card for payment of bills at petrol bunks, hotels, malls or shops. To prevent this, inculcating awareness among customers on the risks involved is crucial. Shop owners too, if they take care to confirm the identity of those producing duplicate cards, can help prevent such frauds, police say. Secondly, it was found that some shop owners themselves were resorting to illegal methods. Some of them would swipe the card given by the customer though the latter doesnt purchase any article. A fake bill for that transaction, say, for example Rs. 10,000, is created. By swiping the card, money from the account of the original cardholder is transferred to that of the shop owner. Since no purchase was made, he would give Rs. 9,000 to the customer, keeping Rs. 1,000 as his commission. Such illegal practices are only helping gangs clone bank cards.  Be it executives at the bank, shopkeepers at the mall or fuel station, data from your debit/credit card is at risk of being stolen like never before, reports MARRI RAMU  OPEN",

        "content": " Opposing the death penalty for those guilty of rape, womens groups have demanded that marital rape, stalking and stripping be regarded as serious offences. The old Penal Code and the proposed amendments exempt marital rape as an offence if a wife is not under 16 years of age. This exemption, totally and unreasonably, ignores the long standing demand of the womens organisations and groups to recognise marital rape as a serious offence, womens groups have said in a representation to the Justice Verma Committee that was set up in the aftermath of the horrific gang-rape in the capital last month. We also recommend deletion of Section 376 A as we see no reason why the punishment for sexual assault on a separated wife should not be the same as ordinary sexual assault, the representation has said while suggesting that consent be also defined as the unequivocal voluntary agreement by a person to engage in the sexual activity in question. One major reason for defining consent in this way is to distinguish consent from mere passiveness. Case law concerning rape is replete with examples in which it has been said that the victim has consented when she has merely remained passive due to a variety of reasons, the groups have said. The joint representation was given by the All India Democratic Womens Association, All India Womens Conference, Centre for Womens Development Studies, Joint Women Programme, Guild of Service, All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch, National Federation of Indian Women, Young Womens Christian Association of India, and Muslim Womens Forum. We have been suggesting that stalking be recognised as a separate offence in the IPC and that an appropriate punishment should be prescribed for it up to 5 years. By not recognising stalking as a crime, most of the perpetrators manage to escape prosecution and can only be charged under Section 509 IPC which is inadequate. Similarly, stripping a woman should also be recognised as a serious sexual offence, the representation says. Rehabilitation Pointing out that relief and rehabilitation of the victim has become an urgent necessity in all cases of sexual assault and other violent crimes like acid attacks, womens groups have said that statutory schemes to provide immediate medical and other relief should immediately be put in place in all States. The scheme should provide for immediate monetary relief to be given to the complainant whether her case is pending in court or not. The amount that is provided should not be subject to an upper limit as has presently been suggested by the National Commission for Women as some victims of violence like those who have suffered acid attacks may need extensive and repeated medical attention apart from other relief. Women subjected to sexual and other forms of violence should be provided with monetary relief during the time they are not in a position to work or earn. For those who can work, a government job should be provided. The Scheme should be administered by a Board which has been properly selected. The Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 2012 introduced by the government in the Lok Sabha seeks to amend the laws relating to sexual assault in the Indian Penal Code. The changes proposed in Section 375 broaden the definition of rape. The section has, however, been made gender neutral which is a reversal of what the government had proposed in 2010.This seems to imply that women could sexually assault men for which there would be no empirical evidence at all. The section would allow men to file false cases of penetrative sexual assault against women. The proposed government Bill in 2010 rightly made the law gender specific and the accused persons could only be men while the complainants/victims were women. According to the womens groups, in clause (b) of Section 376(2), sexual assault at the instigation of/or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other persons acting in an official capacity should also be added as an aggravated form of sexual assault. This clause should also be added in the new section which should deal with aggravated forms of non-penetrative sexual assault. In both the AIDWA proposals and the NCW proposals, clause Sixthly under Section 375 defines statutory rape as rape of a complainant less than 18 years of age. However, taking note of the social reality that there are many instances of consensual sexual activity between young girls above 16 years of age and young boys and that it would lead to injustice if these young boys were prosecuted for rape, the womens groups have suggested an amendment by way of a proviso to the clause to exempt such consensual activity from the purview of statutory rape, provided the accused person is not more than 5 years older.

After a day-long frantic search by residents and fire service personnel, K. Dinesh was found dead inside a stormwater drain in Taramani. Dinesh was the son of Kumar, who runs a petty shop off CSIR Road in Taramani, and Keerthika, a homemaker. The couple, who have a one-year-old daughter too, reside on Peeli Amman Koil Street. On Saturday afternoon, Dinesh was playing with his grandfather Ganapathy who runs a petty shop selling tea on a platform at CSIR Road. Dinesh was fond of his grandfather. Every day, he spent most of his time with Ganapathy, playing near the shop. His parents were going to admit him in school, said A. Vijayakumar, a resident and DYFI functionary of the locality. Around 1 p.m., after lunch, Ganapathy was sleeping in an autorickshaw parked near his shop, while Dinesh was playing in the area. When Ganapathy woke up, his grandson was missing. His parents immediately started searching for him everywhere, said Manikandan, an acquaintance of the family. When the search failed to throw up clues to Dineshs whereabouts, his parents put up posters, with their contact details and Dineshs photo, in the locality. We thought someone might have kidnapped the child. However, since many lids on the platform over the stormwater drain along CSIR Road remain open most of the time, we informed the fire service personnel and requested them to check the drains, said Vijayakumar. Police and fire service personnel who searched for the boy till midnight on Saturday could not find the boy. On Sunday morning, the boys family sought the help of a Chennai Corporation conservancy worker and a resident of the locality, Srinivasalu. Noticing that one of the lids located near Ganapathys shop was open, Srinivasalu went inside the drain, which is four feet deep with slush at the bottom for a depth of two feet. I got inside and checked the left side of the drain. I then went towards the right and found the boys t-shirt. I could not bear the smell of the gas inside, but somehow managed to drag his body out and placed it on the platform, said Srinivasalu, visibly shaken by the incident. I have two kids myself and could not bear the sight, he said. Dineshs body was sent for a post-mortem examination to Royapettah Government General Hospital. Most of the stormwater drain lids in the locality are either broken or missing. Despite repeated requests, the Corporation does not take any efforts to replace them on time, said Vijayakumar. Late on Sunday afternoon, he said, police personnel had replaced the broken lid with a new one. When contacted, J. Parvathi Jothi, the councillor of the locality refused to comment on the issue. A senior Corporation official said a detailed enquiry would be conducted and action taken against responsible persons.  OPEN",

The dentist couple, Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, shared their disappointment with the media stating that they did not expect the CBI to close the case in such a manner. Aarushi's mother blamed the Noida Police for botching up the probe. The couple reiterated that they did whatever they could in a bid to ensure that the case was solved. The CBI must take the case to its logical conclusion, they said. The agency had in June-July 2008 arrested Dr. Talwar's domestic help Krishna, domestic help of their family friend Durranis, Raj Kumar, and Vijay Mandal, domestic help of their neighbour, accusing them of having committed the brutal murders. However, the three were later released on bail as the agency could not come up with any concrete evidence against them. The CBI also made Dr. Talwar and his wife undergo a series of scientific tests, but in vain. Over two-and-half-years after the murders were committed in neighbouring Noida in May 2008, the CBI filed the closure report in the Ghaziabad special court on Wednesday expressing its inability to carry the investigations forward for want of sufficient evidence. The Talwars said they would consult their lawyers to decide the future course of action. However, they said the lawyers had not yet read the closure report and hence they could not say anything about it at this stage.  Will consult the lawyers to decide future action'   Lawyers have not yet read the closure report'  OPEN",

There are three categories of children that need to be protected  those who commit crimes, those in need of care and support and those who are victims of crime, said DCPCR chairperson Amod Kanth. He said that while the first two categories are taken care of by Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, the third category of children, who are often denied justice, need to be addressed. Nine such children's courts, the first of their kind in the country, are likely to come up within a month or two, said Mr. Kanth. He added that identifying pending cases involving child victims is the first step. We have been in talks with the Delhi Police and prosecution [in courts]. The process of identifying such cases that will be transferred to these courts is going on, he added. One of the major roadblocks faced in this regard is that it is not mandatory to specify age of victims in crimes recorded by the National Crime Records Bureau. We are trying to make it a requisite [in the future] to include the age of a victim in official records if the victim is below 18 years of age, said Mr. Kanth. Also, cases where the victim was a child at the time of the crime and the case is still pending would have to be dealt with separately. The children's courts were set up under a provision of the Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CPCR) Act 2005 to deal with the legal protection of children. The Delhi High Court had responded positively to DCPCR's initiative earlier this year by designating such courts under the senior most Additional Session Judges in each district of Delhi.  OPEN",

Matters relating to the party's strategy in the other three States and a Union Territory where elections are also to be held later this year, besides that for West Bengal, are expected to be discussed. The meeting comes at a time when a 40-day programme is being undertaken by the CPI(M)-led Left Front in the State to highlight the failure of the Centre's economic policies to protect the interests of the working class. The programme will culminate with a rally at the Brigade Parade grounds here on February 13, which will kick-start the Left Front's campaign for the coming Assembly polls. On the violence in the State, particularly in the context of the recent incident at Netai in the Lalgarh area, the CPI (M) Polit Bureau has already taken a serious view of partisan statements issued by Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram which fails to ensure that Cabinet colleague and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee break her party's links with the Maoists. The Polit Bureau is getting together ahead of a meeting between Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mr. Chidambaram scheduled for January 19. Mr. Bhattacharjee is also expected to hold talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on that day. The party's strategy in Parliament on the 2G spectrum issue, when it meets for the Budget session in February, is also likely to be taken up at the meeting.  OPEN",

The constable felt that the burglar might have been inspired by the movie. The constable told his seniors that the burglar in the movie used to identify a place inside the house to hide himself and walk out only after the situation had diffused. The police team along with those present in the gurdwara searched the premises but did not find anyone. Not satisfied, the constable again searched the premises and found a man hiding under heaps of sacks in a generator room. He was later identified as Manjeet Singh, a resident of Sham Nagar. The stolen cash and a clock were allegedly seized from him.

The decision to this affect was taken at a meeting presided over by Gurgaon Police Commissioner Alok Mittal and attended by several senior police and MCG officials. According to Mr. Mittal, the company has been requested to complete this exercise by the month end. He further said that the ECIL has also been asked to lay its own fibre cables for the project and set up separate control rooms for the police and the MCG. The company will also install a public address system in Sadar Bazaar at several points so that necessary announcements could be made as per the need.   OPEN",

        "content": " Defence Minister A.K. Antony maintained that the killing of five jawans of the Bihar regiment on the Line of Control in the Poonch sector on Tuesday was the handiwork of armed terrorists dressed in Pakistani Army uniform. Making a suo motu statement in the Rajya Sabha, he rejected the Opposition charge that the government bailed out Pakistan by blaming it on terrorists and said his was a proper response in the present juncture as the incident had occurred early in the day and he did not want to jump to conclusions. Referring to questions raised by Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley, the Minister said his statement was based on confirmed reports that he received at the time of his response in the House. With most parties calling for a fitting reply to Pakistan, Mr. Antony said the fact that the House displayed unity while discussing the critical issue of national security was in itself the strongest answer to our enemy. He said he would not go into the details of the incident but the government had lodged a strong protest with Pakistan through diplomatic channels against the manner in which the ambush was carried out by 20 heavily armed terrorists dressed in Pakistani Army uniform. The statement acknowledged that infiltration attempts doubled this year and ceasefire violations went up by 80 per cent, with 57 incidents reported so far this year. While 17 infiltration bids were foiled this year, 19 hardcore terrorists were killed in July and August along the LoC and in Jammu and Kashmir. The Opposition parties attacked Mr. Antonys statement for failing to assert Indias position. They said the incident was the outcome of Indias failed foreign policy. Mr. Jaitley said cross-border terrorism had increased, and Tuesdays incident should not be seen in isolation but against the backdrop of the beheading of Indian soldiers, the murderous attack on the death row prisoner Sarabjit Singh, the bomb blast in Afghanistan and the incursions along the Chinese border. By holding terrorists responsible, India was giving an escape route to Pakistan, which had always denied promoting cross-border terrorism. Pakistan is not entitled to any benefit of doubt. Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Verma called for a fitting action to end the increasing incursions. Sitaram Yechury of the CPI(M) questioned how the Minister could make a categorical statement that terrorists were behind the killings. It was an attempt to justify ourselves that it was not an India-Pakistan issue. D. Raja of the CPI said that protesting through diplomatic channels was irrelevant, and the Prime Minister should have talked to his Pakistani counterpart. He also wanted to know whether New Delhi would hold to the composite dialogue process. Mayawati of the BSP called for a review of Indias foreign policy and V. Maitreyan of the AIADMK said that it was because of the failed handling of foreign affairs, even neighbours had become hostile to India. Kanimozhi of the DMK said the country was looking to the distant future, ignoring the present problems caused by its neighbours. Sukhendu Seker Roy of the TMC said the Defence Minister had not categorically blamed terrorists as the headline of his statement read Ambush incident by Pak Army. He should explain the ambiguity.

Keshavamurthy in Mahalakshmi Layout here on Saturday night following which the police arrested one of the gang members identified as Kumar alias Bhagyanath (45). The attackers, who tried breaking into the house, smashed the window panes and broke the grills. The landlord of the house, who intervened, was assaulted by the assailants. He was taken to a hospital. Mr. Keshavamurthy was not home when the four men came looking for him. Speaking to The Hindu , his wife, Chethana Keshavamurthy, said: I was alone at the house when two men came around 10.30 p.m. and knocked on the door. When I opened the door and asked them who it was, one of them said that his name was Bhagyanath. They appeared to be in an inebriated state. However, when they realised that the councillor was not at home, they went away. Mrs. Keshavamurthy said that around 11.30 p.m., there were loud knocks on her door again. As she was apprehensive, she did not open the door, but the men tried to break the lock to enter the house. They broke the window panes of the kitchen and broke the grill outside the house. When the landlord Kempanna, who lives upstairs, intervened, the gang assaulted him with flower pots and footwear kept outside the house, she said. The attackers also carried a knife with them, she added. Meanwhile, Mr. Keshavamurthy, who had gone out for dinner, said that he received a call from his wife informing him of the chaos following which he alerted the police. The gang members, however, escaped from the spot in an autorickshaw. Mr. Keshavamurthy also said that another gang member, who had introduced himself as Kaveri, had threatened the family by claiming that he was earlier involved in the murder of Malleswaram Councillor Nataraj. The police said that the accused Bhagyanath had taken a loan from a private bank for construction of a three-storey building in Mahalakshmi Layout nearly six years ago. Bhagyanath, however, had not repaid the loan and had been requesting the councillor, who is also the president of the bank, to reduce the interest on the loan. However, the bank issued a notice to Bhagyanath. Though there is a suspicion that this might be the reason behind the attack, the police are yet to ascertain it. Mr. Keshavamurthy, however, said that the bank loan may not be connected to the attack at all. It may be because of political vendetta due to the elections. Without some political backing, the attackers may not have had the courage to launch an attack on a councillor, he said. Mrs. Keshavamurthy also said that the gang members were heard talking about the Mahalakshmipuram councillor not supporting Babanna and Ravianna referring to the local MLA N.L. Narendra Babu and his younger brother Ravi. Though the councillor said that he had no issues with the MLA, he suspected that some of his supporters may have been involved in the attack. Meanwhile, Mr. Narendra Babu has said that the accused, who was arrested, was not his supporter and that he had no involvement in the issue.  The Mahalakshmi Layout police have registered a case. Councillor S. Keshavamurthy was not at home when the attack took placeHis wife says their landlord, who intervened, was assaulted by the gang Councillor S.

Home Secretary G. K. Pillai said it was planned to unilaterally issue six-month multiple entry permits for the people of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) wanting to visit Jammu and Kashmir through the Line of Control (LoC). As a confidence building measure, the strength of the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir would come down by 25 per cent. We would like to reduce it as soon as possible depending on the ground situation, he said at a seminar at the Jamia Millia Islamia University here. Mr. Pillai said some forces had been taken out of Srinagar and 16 bunkers removed. It was an ongoing process. Deployment of security forces should be of minimum strength in populated areas and management by local police would be the ideal situation. If there is no violence and if people are comfortable, we can gradually reduce the strength of security forces and make sure that all forces are only at the border and for preventing infiltration, he said. As part of the confidence building measures, India and Pakistan allowed people from Jammu and Kashmir and PoK to visit either side, with a permit valid for 15 days. We suggested that the people visit their relatives more often. If you give 15 days permit, they have to go through the verification process. So why don't we give a six-month multiple entry permit, we suggested. Once verification is done, one can visit relatives whenever he or she wants. Now we are planning to unilaterally give six month multiple entry permits for the people of PoK, he said.  When asked by a Kashmiri student why it took four months for the Centre to react to the deaths of students in J&K during last summer, Mr. Pillai admitted that it should not have taken so long, but added that governance is a huge issue for the Centre.

Dayandhi began re-inquiry into the alleged concealing of facts in the previous report submitted to Lok Ayukta. The re-inquiry assumes significance in the wake of Lok Ayuktas order to the District Collector Saurabh Gaur to appear before it on January 7. Mr. Saurabh Gaur, who was recently posted to Srikakulam district, ordered re-inquiry to get all the details from the local officials. The tribals recently approached the Lok Ayukta seeking re-inquiry into the incident alleging that the officials who worked earlier in the district had intentionally concealed the facts to mislead even Lok Ayukta. According to the tribals, the officials did not mention the fact that pattas were given to tribal farmers in the land coming under survey no-289 where granite lease was granted to Dharmana family. As many as 21 tribals were sanctioned pattas in the same area but it was not reflected in the previous reports to mislead the government and in turn pave the way to granting of lease to the Ministers family without any hindrance. On Saturday, the officials found that a few farmers who were allocated land in the area were growing cashew and other crops. The second fact that was allegedly concealed was that habitations were very close to the mining area. The survey conducted on Saturday proved that Tumukimanuguda village was located very near to the area. Mr. Dayanidhi promised the tribals that he would submit a detailed report soon explaining the truths.

Sources in the government say the Ministry has asked the Delhi Police to enquire into the incident and take necessary action. Following the news report in The Hindu, A gang rape Delhi policemen got away with?, officials of the Ministry asked senior police officials to investigate the matter. Though senior Ministry officials remained tight-lipped on the issue, the sources said the police have begun an informal investigation into the whole matter. When contacted, the Delhi Police spokesperson refused to comment on the issue. The sources said the police would also discuss the issue with the three members of the committee  Mr. J.S. Verma, a former Chief Justice of India; the former Chief Justice of Himachal Pradesh High Court, Justice Leila Seth; and the former Solicitor-General of India, Gopal Subramaniam. In its report Amendments to Criminal Law, the committee included the detailed interview of four street-children who stated that they were witness to a gang rape near some place of worship that involved three policemen deployed in a police control room (PCR) van. Ironically, neither the Ministry nor the Delhi Police took cognisance of the case though the committee report had been submitted to the government almost a month ago. Informed sources said the Ministry officials concentrated only on the main recommendations of the report and subsequently came out with an ordinance to make rape laws more stringent. The officials apparently failed to go through the Appendices of the 631-page report that carried the interview of the four trafficked children. They claimed that they saw the gang rape by the three policemen who had abducted a girl from near a temple situated close to some old, vacant buildings and a ridge. Though as per rules, the committee was bound to lodge a formal compliant with the police in this regard, it chose to keep mum fearing for the safety of these kids. But we made the exhaustive interview a part of the report to show the deeper malaise in the system the report is now with the Ministry of Home Affairs and it is they who have to act on it, Mr. Subramaniam told The Hindu . Mr. Subramaniam said that they (members) did discuss the issue and then unanimously decided not to pursue it as the safety and security of the children was their primary concern. We debated this issueIt was a moving moment for us. We did not file a case as these kids come from the weaker sections of societywe wanted to protect their identity as we feared that police might launch some kind of vendetta against them...We wanted to save them from the system, he said.

        "content": " Nine political parties, including four Left parties, on Thursday announced a week-long nationwide agitation against price rise. The United Progressive Alliance government was callous to the plight of people groaning under spiralling prices of food items, they alleged. We have decided to jointly conduct a week-long agitation against the price rise from February 3 to 9. During the week, there will be demonstrations, dharnas, rallies and picketing of Central government offices, with a mass dharna on the last day,'' Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Prakash Karat said after a meeting of party leaders. Besides demanding immediate steps to check the price rise, the parties would press the government to take steps such as ending forward trading in food and essential commodities, universalising the public distribution system, taking firm measures against hoarding, paying remunerative prices to farmers and giving inputs at reasonable cost, ending deregulation of petroleum products and rolling back the budgetary hikes on petro products and not allowing foreign capital in retail trade. An iniquitous tax  In a joint release, leaders of the parties said while food inflation remained unbearably high, a general inflation of 8.5 per cent was an iniquitous tax on people. While people suffered under price rise, the country was witnessing rampant corruption and plunder of resources. Yet, the UPA government remains callous to the plight of the people. False assurances are given that the prices will come down within a short period. The Ministers are giving differing and contradictory statements regarding the price rise and how to tackle it, the release said. They charged the government with not taking any effective measures to curb the price rise. On the contrary, it pursued policies that fuelled inflation. Since deregulation, petrol prices were hiked seven times, leading to 20 per cent rise in the price. The government had not stopped speculation through forward trading in food items and essential commodities, and export-import measures for commodities such as onions had fuelled the price rise. This only helped private trading companies to make huge profits. The price rise had hit farmers and in many areas, they continued to be in distress and committed suicide. Neither do they get remunerative prices nor compensated adequately for crop losses. The Central government had not extended adequate assistance to meet the losses due to unseasonal rains, the release said. FDI in retail trade Coming out strongly against the move to allow 51 per cent FDI in retail trade, the leaders said this would mean loss of livelihood for lakhs of shopkeepers and traders. Besides, Mr. Karat, those who attended the meeting included Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M), A.B. Bardhan and Atul Kumar Anjan (CPI), Debabrata Biswas and G. Devarajan (AIFB), Abani Roy (RSP), Nama Nageswara Rao (TDP), M. Thambidurai (AIADMK), Ajit Singh (RLD). JD(S) president H.D.

        "content": " Kashmir University authorities on Saturday stopped the screening of a film which contains heart-rending visuals of conflict victims and holds the Army and paramilitary responsible for human rights abuses in Kashmir. However, the documentary of 27-minute duration, made in Kashmiri and English, has been funded by subsidiaries of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB), and has also been certified as legitimate by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). A gathering of more than 200 men and women  mostly students, teachers, filmmakers and social activists  raised slogans outside the KUs Convocation Hall in favour of Azadi and the hardliner separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani. They alleged that the KU authorities initially allowed screening of the film and collected the stipulated fee from the director, but finally disallowed the event under police pressure. They are more loyal than the king, co-researcher and director of the film titled Ocean of Tears , Bilal Jan, complained to The Hindu . We had completed all the procedural formalities. They previewed and cleared the documentary, and thereafter made us deposit a fee of Rs. 20,000. We got sponsors and put up paid advertisements in local newspapers. A gathering of more than 200 eminent persons turned up to attend the screening. But, at the eleventh hour, we were told that the screening couldnt be allowed, as according to them, someone had submitted a complaint, claiming that the director had plagiarised his footage, Mr. Jan explained. According to Mr. Jan, Superintendent of Police, Hazratbal zone, Abdul Qayoom remained closeted with the KU Registrar, Professor Zaffar Ahmad Rishi, for a long time, and the police prevented the invitees from entering the auditorium. He confirmed that the film was selectively on the plight of women who had been raped and tortured by the Army, their sons who had been killed and husbands subjected to enforced disappearance. However, he insisted, there was nothing wrong or unlawful in making and screening such a documentary as, according to him, it had been approved and funded by MIBs Films Division and a key subsidiary, the Public Service Broadcasting Trust (PSBT). According to Mr. Jans statement and documents, the film had been cleared by PSBTs eminent panel of filmmakers and critics. They included FTII Punes Professor (Film) Suresh Chhabria, the former director-general of Doordarshan, Bhaskar Ghosh, and prominent critic K. Vikram. It credits the high-profile filmmaker, Rajiv Mehrotra, as the producer of the film. Anchor of DDs longest-run talk show In Conversation and a graduate in Master of Fine Arts in Film Direction from the University of Columbia in 1981, Mr. Mehrotra played a key role in producing the film and getting it cleared from the censor authorities, Mr. Jan said. From 2000, he has been Managing Trustee, Executive Producer and Commissioning Editor of The Public Service Broadcasting Trust (PSBT), which has produced more than 400 documentary films, winning some 100 awards from 250 international film festival screenings. His films have won numerous international awards and 18 national awards from the President of India, Mr. Mehrotras profile on Wikipedia says. Yes, its true that almost all the local business tycoons and prominent NGOs refused to sponsor the screening event. They invariably argued that the film ran against the government agencies and its CBFC certificate and PSBT sponsorship wasnt enough, Mr. Jan revealed. He informed that the main part of the film was on the infamous Kunan-Poshpora (Kupwara) alleged mass rape of February 1991, and the rape-cum-murder of two young women in Shopian in 2009. A 7-minute video, which has been running on YouTube since October this year, has recorded 145,000 views until Saturday. It carries emotional statements of the victims of state terror, all invariably holding Army and paramilitary forces guilty of gang rape, murder, custodial killing and torture. It does not contain the reaction of the Army, the BSF, the CRPF or any government agency to the explicitly-used statements. Mr. Jan said the CBFC members were divided regarding clearing the film, but chairperson Leela Samson was assertive in convincing the people who were against its clearance. KUs Registrar, Professor Zaffar Ahmad Rishi, insisted that the screening was stopped only after a local activist of a Gujarat-based NGO complained that his work had been plagiarised by the producers and researchers of the documentary. We had given the permission [for screening], but once we received the complaint we withdrew it, Professor Rishi told The Hindu . Copyright and plagiarism is a big issue in universities these days.

Bhardwaj and the State Government hit a new low on Thursday with the former obliquely referring to the Chief Minister and his Council of Ministers as chor. Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa and eight senior Ministers have taken serious exception to it saying that it has deeply hurt Kannadiga pride. On the sidelines of a programme here, the Governor told presspersons that the BJP's crusade against him, particularly the decision to hold a Statewide protest on January 22, was a case of a thief scolding the police ( ulta chor kothwal ko daten). All these things are part of their politics. It doesn't scare or worry me. Mr. Bhardwaj also categorically stated that his decision on granting sanction to a request by two advocates to prosecute the Chief Minister and the Home Minister would be announced in two days. Reacting sharply to the Governor likening the State Cabinet's resolution urging him not to give permission to prosecute the Chief Minister to a thief scolding the police, Mr. Yeddyurappa, in a strongly worded letter to the Governor, said, By stating that the decision of the Cabinet is like a thief giving a complaint against the police, Your Excellency has lowered the dignity of the Chief Minister, the entire Cabinet and thereby the voters of Karnataka. Such repeated statements by you do not inspire any confidence that a decision by you [on sanction of prosecution] would be unbiased, fair and bona fide. On the other hand, it is patently clear that you have adopted a biased attitude. Perhaps, this is in line with your political affiliation and inclination to unduly embarrass the Government. The Chief Minister said, Through this letter I would like to formally record my protest against prejudging the issue and for making completely uncalled for statements which have hurt the entire Cabinet and the people of Karnataka. In view of your continued bias, it will only be appropriate for you to refrain from granting sanction for prosecution. A group of eight Ministers  V. S. Acharya, S. Suresh Kumar, R. Ashok, Govind Karjol, C.M. Udasi, Basavaraj Bommai, V. Somanna and M. P. Renukacharya  also hit back at the Governor for his statement and said it was amply evident that the Governor had already decided to give his nod to prosecute the Chief Minister and the Home Minister even before studying the documents submitted by the Government.

Advani on Thursday voiced support for the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha's (BJYM) plans to hoist the national Tricolour at Lal Chowk in Srinagar on Republic Day, despite demands from various quarters to drop the plan. The Srinagar-bound Rashtriya Ekta Yatra started from Kolkata on January 12 led by BJYM president Anurag Thakur and reached the Capital on Thursday after traversing seven States in nine days. Speaking at a reception accorded to the Yatra at the Constitution Club here, Mr. Advani wondered how hoisting the Tricolour could be viewed as throwing a challenge to anyone. It is only the separatists who will see it as a challenge. Only the nation's enemies will be provoked by the national flag being hoisted, he said. Mr. Advani took exception to Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's reported statement that the erstwhile princely State had only acceded to India and not merged with the country. Drawing parallels between the present Yatra and the journey by Jan Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee to Kashmir where he died, Mr. Advani said while Mr. Mookerjee's death was an irreparable loss to the party, the nation benefited by the abolition of special privileges for the State soon after. I am not sure if it is linked, but soon after his death the permits for Indian citizens to visit Kashmir and the posts of Prime Minister and Sadr-e-Riyasat were abolished and the State came under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Election Commission and other statutory bodies. Mr. Thakur who represents Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh, in the Lok Sabha, said the Yatra was meant to protect the unity and integrity of the country.  OPEN",

        "content": " A key belief of climate science theology  that a reduction in carbon emissions will take care of the bulk of global warming  has been questioned in a scientific paper released by the Environment Ministry on Monday. Physicist and the former ISRO chairman, U.R. Rao, has calculated that cosmic rays  which, unlike carbon emissions, cannot be controlled by human activity  have a much larger impact on climate change than The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) claims. In fact, the contribution of decreasing cosmic ray activity to climate change is almost 40 per cent, argues Dr. Rao in a paper which has been accepted for publication in Current Science, the preeminent Indian science journal. The IPCC model, on the other hand, says that the contribution of carbon emissions is over 90 per cent. Cosmic ray impact ignored' Releasing Dr. Rao's findings as a discussion paper on Thursday, Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh noted that the impact of cosmic ray intensity on climate change has thus far been largely ignored by the mainstream scientific consensus. He added that the unidimensional focus on carbon emissions by most Western countries put additional pressure on countries like India in international climate negotiations. The continuing increase in solar activity has caused a 9 per cent decrease in cosmic ray intensity over the last 150 years, which results in less cloud cover, which in turn results in less albedo radiation being reflected back to the space, causing an increase in the Earth's surface temperature. While the impact of cosmic rays on climate change has been studied before, Dr. Rao's paper quantifies their contribution to global warming and concludes that the future prediction of global warming presented by IPCC's fourth report requires a relook to take into the effect due to long term changes in the galactic cosmic ray intensity. Policy implications This could have serious policy implications. If human activity cannot influence such a significant cause of climate change as cosmic rays, it could change the kind of pressure put on countries to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Mr. Ramesh emphasised that Dr. Rao's findings would not reduce domestic action on climate change issues, but he admitted that it could influence the atmosphere of international negotiations. International climate negotiations are about climate politics. But increasingly, science is becoming the handmaiden of politics, he said. In November 2009, Mr. Ramesh had released a report by glaciologist V.K. Raina claiming that Himalayan glaciers are not all retreating at an alarming pace. It had been disputed by many Western scientists, while IPCC chairman R.K. Pachauri dismissed it as voodoo science. However, Dr. Raina was later vindicated by the IPCC's own retraction of its claim that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035. Since then, Western Ministers have reduced talk about the glaciers to me, they have stopped using it as frequently as a pressure point for India to come on board, said Mr. Ramesh. When Mr. Ramesh sent Dr. Rao's paper to Dr. Pachauri, he replied that the next IPCC report was paying special attention to the impact of cloud cover on global warming. The Minister expressed hope that Dr. Rao's findings would be seriously studied by climate researchers. There is a groupthink in climate science today. Anyone who raises alternative climate theories is immediately branded as a climate atheist in an atmosphere of climate evangelists, he said. Climate science is incredibly more complex than [developed countries] negotiators make it out to be Climate science should not be driven by the West. We should not always be dependent on outside reports. Disputing IPCC claims According to the latest report by the IPCC, all human activity, including carbon dioxide emissions, contribute 1.6 watts/sq.m to global warming, while other factors such as solar irradiance contribute just 0.12 watts/sq.m. However, Dr. Rao's paper calculates that the effect of cosmic rays contributes 1.1 watts/sq.m, taking the total contribution of non-human activity factors to 1.22 watts/sq.m. This means that increased carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere are not as significant as the IPCC claims. Of the total observed global warming of 0.75 degrees Celsius, only 0.42 degrees would be caused by increased carbon dioxide. The rest would be caused by the long term decrease in primary cosmic ray intensity and its effect on low level cloud cover. This means that predicting future global warming and sea level rise is not as simple as the IPCC makes it to be, since it depends not only on human activity, but also significantly on the unpredictability of cosmic ray intensity. We conclude that the contribution to climate change due to the change in galactic cosmic ray intensity is quite significant and needs to be factored into the prediction of global warming and its effect on sea level raise and weather prediction, says the paper.

        "content": " The closure report filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the sensational Aarushi Talwar-Hemraj murder case has raised doubts about the conduct of the young girl's father, Dr. Rajesh Talwar, as he was allegedly unable to explain certain circumstances. The report mentions the name of Dr. Talwar as the only suspect, making it amply clear that he was under scrutiny for some reasons  one being that the two murders were in all probability committed by someone present in the house, which was not broken into by anyone on the fateful night. Secondly, it is learnt that the CBI found that the door to the terrace  where the body of Hemraj was discovered  never used to be locked earlier. The investigating agency could not get an answer to that from the Talwars. The investigators also suspect that attempts were made by a relative of the Talwars to influence the doctor who conducted post-mortem on Aarushi's body. However, the CBI has not come across any substantial proof against Dr. Talwar to charge-sheet him in the case. On the other hand, the three other suspects -- Dr. Talwar's domestic help Krishna, his family friend Durranis' domestic help Raj Kumar and Vijay Mandal, the domestic help of his neighbour -- have virtually been given a clean chit as their alibis have been established as per the new findings. The three were earlier arrested by another CBI team that on the basis of alleged findings of scientific tests such as brain-mapping and narco-analysis had claimed that they had brutally murdered Aarushi and Hemraj. The suspicions reportedly raised by the CBI in its report have been rubbished by the Talwars. Aarushi's mother Nupur Talwar accused the CBI of doing a cover-up of the shoddy investigation conducted by the Uttar Pradesh police. Dr. Rajesh Talwar told NDTV: I have had enough of this. This is the second time I am going through this. This is what they do to innocent people, an innocent father who has lost his child. I cannot understand this kind of investigative agency. I have no words for them. Do they care about Aarushi? Do they care about my child? Aarushi is dead and gone, said Ms. Talwar, adding How can they make allegations without evidence? PTI reports: The dentist couple dismissed the CBI allegations that they tried to influence the doctor who conducted the post-mortem, saying these were absolutely concocted. Asked about the records that ostensibly indicate that a call was made to the doctor conducting the post-mortem, Ms. Talwar said: What does indicate mean? They have call records. Either they know a call was made or they don't. You don't get indications where a call comes from. Dr. Rajesh Talwar said that he had extended all possible cooperation in the probe. I opened my mind to them. I underwent lie detector, brain-mappingand what have they done? Ms. Talwar said: It is their job to get evidence. They don't find evidence, then how do they hurl allegations. On the question that Mr. Talwar was surfing the net at the time of murder, he said he had never denied that he was doing that. I had told them I was surfing the net till 11-30 when I got a call from my brother. After completing the conversation, I switched off the net and went to sleep, he said. Asked whether he had refused to identify the body of Hemraj, Ms. Talwar said that they had collected the ashes of their daughter and were going to Haridwar when the call came that a body has been found on the terrace. He [Rajesh] was not a normal person. He had collected ashes of his daughter...The body was swollen and two day old. What do they expect of him? she said. I had told them that it could be his body but I was not sure, said Dr. Talwar, adding that he called Nupur to ask what was Hemraj wearing and then called the police again to say that the body could be of Hemraj.

Sometimes, these symptoms would suggest acid reflux, ulcer and even cancer. People with these symptoms should seek proper medical advice. These are lifestyle disorders and require changes in the lifestyle and dietary alterations for cure, said Dr. Palaniswamy.

The police received a call in the early hours of Saturday saying that a young man, later identified as Shubham, was lying dead in a pool of blood in his house in Sector 18 in Rohini. A crime team that was called in found a firearm injury on the upper abdomen of the deceased. A double-barrel gun was found lying next to the body, said a senior police officer. His father Subhash Aggarwal purportedly told the police that Shubham had committed suicide using a screw driver. While questioning family members, the police learnt from Subhashs sister that that their father, an alcoholic, was unemployed and did not contribute to the familys income. The children were forced to fend for themselves and this led to frequent quarrels between him and other members of the family. Subhash was subsequently subjected to sustained interrogation and he ultimately confessed to his crime, said the officer. Subhash alleged that ever since he stopped earning owing to losses suffered in his businesses his children treated him badly and even beat him up. On the night of the incident, his son humiliated him and Subhash decided to eliminate his son. He waited till all his family members fell asleep and then entered Shubhams room. He shut the door of the bedroom, took out his licensed double-barrel gun and shot him in the chest from a very close range. Shubham was a first year BTech student in a college in Alipur.  OPEN",

        "content": " Protesting against the Centres proposal to extend the cash transfer scheme to the Public Distribution System, the Right to Food Campaign on Saturday demanded that the government bring in a comprehensive national food security Act that provides for universal PDS. Ensuring nutrition through various measures should be the focus of the Bill. The Bill is under consideration of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Food. Participating in the concluding session of the three-day protest rally here, economist Jayati Ghosh argued that a universal PDS was an essential part of sound economic policy. She expressed the apprehension that the main beneficiaries of cash transfers would be commercial enterprises. While Nikhil Dey of the Masdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan was appalled that the government was holding on to huge foodgrains stock rather than distribute it to the poor, Bezwada Wilson representing the Safai Karamchari Andolan observed that in a welfare state this sort of dharna would not be necessary if food security and other basic needs were addressed. A.K. Shiva Kumar pointed out that the Unique Identification scheme ended up excluding the poor from the system, instead of including them. Activist Jean Dreze recalled the earlier achievements of the Right to Food Campaign and pointed out that it was about time that a comprehensive Act was brought, not to indulge piecemeal measures. Kavita Srivastava said the struggle for peoples right to food will continue and the Campaign will hold a convention on the right to food in New Delhi during the budget session. The Campaign, a conglomeration of several NGOs, has been seeking universal PDS linked to Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) , nutritious midday meals and also other essential entitlements such as social security pensions and maternity entitlements.

Venkatesan, Director, National Commission for Scheduled Caste (NCSC). It was on Thursday night that an armed group of caste Hindu barged into the Dalit hamlet (Thotti colony) and attacked the residents, including women, and damaged utensils, furniture and two-wheelers. The group, which raided houses targeting young Dalit boys, fled on seeing the policemen. At least nine Dalits, mostly women, were injured in the incident. The attack was sequel to a fracas between a Dalit youth and a caste Hindu man. The drunk mob of around 30 persons, which emerged from a grove, carried out indiscriminate attack on us - women, elderly and children - in the dark. They broke open doors of houses, dragged women out, and beat them up with wooden logs as they couldnt find youngsters, said B. Selvaraj, an elder of the village. B. Annalakshmi (38), who was among those attacked, said that the incident had traumatised women, young girls and elders. They could not sleep well for the past three nights. Most of the victims were innocent and in no way connected with any incident. Based on inputs, a two-member team, including Mr. Venkatesan, and S. Lister, Investigator, NCSC, visited the colony and inspected the damaged houses. They also interacted with the victims and witnesses. After meeting revenue and police officials, Mr. Venkatesan told The Hindu that he saw many houses, utensils, two-wheelers and furniture that were damaged. Some of the victims were traumatised. Though the police had registered a case against a group of persons, the team was of the view that it should be investigated thoroughly to find out the reasons for the attack. The team would soon send a report to NCSC in New Delhi for further action. Asked whether it was a sequel to the inflammatory speeches in connection with the Dharmapuri incident, Mr. Venkatesan said it had to be investigated. He said it was a third such attack in Tamil Nadu against Dalits in the recent weeks.  OPEN",

Kodagu Deputy Commissioner N.V. Prasad was told to take measures to check the discharge of effluents into the Cauvery by houses located on river banks. Mr. Reddy suggested to Dr. Prasad to involve the Deputy Conservators of Forests in Kodagu to prepare a master plan for the development of degraded forests in Kodagu. Mr. Kumar, responding to a tribal issue, asked Dr. Prasad not to uproot them from forests but to ensure development without affecting their lives.

The 23-year old girl from Buddhagaram in Thirumarugal here was working as a nurse in a private hospital in Tiruvarur. Her body was found mangled on the railway tracks in Thirupanayur in Nannilam in Tiruvarur. The police have since arrested a 32-year old man, the girls neighbour, who had reportedly picked her up to drop her back in the village. According to sources, the man, already married, had picked her up in the pretext of dropping her home, but had stopped in an isolated spot to sexually assault her. The man allegedly strangled her following her resistance and threw her body on the tracks. According to the protesting AIDWA members and villagers, supported by Keezhvelur CPI(M) MLA Naagai Maali, the arrested man could not have committed the crime himself, and had accomplices to the crime. The villagers have demanded action calling for more arrests.  OPEN",

As the VSP management is trying to restore normality after the confidence level of the workforce got hit following the massive explosion in the oxygen pressure reducing station in the newly-built Steel Melt Shop-II, probe into the incident have already started by multiple agencies. The blast claimed lives of 16 employees so far. A senior official of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, the corporate entity of VSP, told The Hindu that an internal inquiry would be conducted to fix responsibility on those found guilty for safety lapse if any. There is no official word on the cause of the accident which occurred in a tiny room located in one corner of the SMS-II compound. Sub-standard pipeline Employees including those working SMS Department allege the use of sub-standard pipeline leading to pressure problem in production of hot metal. This subsequently believed to have caused the blast and converted the oxygen pressure room into a death chamber. Prior to the SMS accident, the conveyer at the Sinter Plant got burnt on May 21 and two workers died in another blast at the Blast Furnace-3 on May 1. The Director of Factories, who was asked by Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy, has already launched the investigation into the June 13 incident. One of the top officials of the department has recommended safety audit by third party, which VSP Chairman-cum-Managing Director A.P. Choudhary agreed to conduct at the earliest. On the advice of National Legal Service Authority (NALSA) headed by a Supreme Court Judge, the District Legal Service Authority (DLSA) conducted a preliminary probe into the incident. Two senior civil judges from the city went to the blast site, took photographs and interacted with the officials to find out some details about the accident. The Jain Committee will investigate into the incident to ascertain the sequence of events and determine the exact cause of blast. According to the terms of reference, it will ascertain whether all the trial runs were conducted as per the requirements and proper safety protocols were followed. It has been given one month to submit a report. We are very happy that on our suggestion, the management has agreed to inspect all the machinery in the expansion project by third party, said Steel Plant Employees Union deputy general secretary V.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi, which has not indicated its mind on WTC, the YSR Congress and MIM did not attend.

The Chief Minister told the representatives that an action plan would be adopted at the conference to ensure that every child in each house in the State spoke Telugu. There was also need for children to opt for English but without slighting Telugu. Mr Reddy said efforts should be galvanised towards making children competitive with a command over English, and, at the same time, to protect the mother tongue, seeking suggestions from all quarters to achieve these twin objectives. Ruling out the possibility of protecting Telugu and Telugu culture through mere GOs, he advocated concerted efforts instead by parents to attract the child to native language and culture. G. Butchaiah Chowdary (Telugu Desam) wanted a photo of late N. T. Rama Rao to be installed at the WTC and to be displayed in the brochures, as he symbolised Telugu self-respect. Ch.

The Virudhunagar district police said M. Sangaiah (35) of Kokkadi in Ramanathapuram district was herding some 300 sheep near Bommanayakkanpatti bus stop near Paralachi. When the sheep were crossing the Aruppukottai-Paralachi road at around 7 p.m., the speeding lorry ploughed through the animals killing 38 of them on the spot. The driver, K. Veerabathran (40) of North Mookaiahpuram of Tuticorin district, was arrested. Preliminary inquiries suggested that a private crusher unit in the locality had hired the vehicle. Thick dust had settled down on the windscreen of the lorry, which had partially hindered clear vision of the road for the driver. This had led to the accident. Besides, the driver had claimed that he had swerved the vehicle to avoid knocking down a man on the road and eventually mowed down the animals.   OPEN",

Azeem and Khan were arrested and remanded in judicial custody. The two accused, along with their friend Shaik Jahangir, boarded a bus to reach Charminar on November 1. During the journey, Azeem teased Khan who picked up an argument with him. Shouting at one another, they got off at Nayapul. Jahangir too alighted. Meanwhile, the other two continued to quarrel when Azeem attacked Jahangir with a blade. By the time the third one joined them, the duo cooked up a story of some miscreants attacking them after finding out their names. The Mirchowk police registered a case of assault. After recording statements of several persons, including a security guard of an ATM centre, the investigators found that the blade attack story was false.  OPEN",

        "content": " As the Madras High Court is enquiring into the DMKs petition challenging construction of a structure resembling the two leaves symbol (of the AIADMK) at the recently renovated memorial of the former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and AIADMK founder, M.G. Ramachandran, on the Marina beach in Chennai, the Election Commission has made it clear that it has no role to play now. The model code of conduct and other restrictions on campaigning will be in force only when election is announced and as of now we cannot do anything even if it is proved that the structure is in fact the election symbol of the AIADMK, a senior Election Commission official told The Hindu here. While the DMK claims that the structure is in fact the AIADMKs symbol and wants it removed, the Tamil Nadu government maintains that it is not the symbol of the AIADMK as approved by the EC. The government has claimed that it was a Y shaped structure with two wings, a honeycomb jaali arrangement at the top portion and Pegasus, a flying horse. There is no similarity between the structure and the party symbol, it reiterated. The DMK had even petitioned the Chief Secretary and the Chief Election Commissioner to stop the addition of the two leaves to the MGR memorial at public cost. A symbol of a political party cannot be constructed at the cost of public money on a government property. A party in power cannot canvas for itself by erecting a permanent structure of its own symbol. This is misuse and gross abuse of power, besides a breach of trust and wastage of public money, the DMK had said. The EC official said that when the Lok Sabha/Assembly segment under which the MGR memorial was located goes to polls, the Commission might take a decision on draping the structure, if at all it was satisfied that the structure indeed was an election symbol. At that time the Commission would ensure a level playing field and a free and fair election. He pointed to the ECs order early this year on draping of statues of the former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati, and her party symbol, elephant, when the State went to Assembly polls. Even prior to the May 2004 Lok Sabha elections, a similar order to drape photographs/portraits of the then Prime Minister and BJP leader, A.B. Vajpayee, installed on highways and at golden quadrilateral road projects, was issued and it was adhered to, recalled a senior EC official. There used to be huge boards along the developed/underdeveloped highways, with photographs of a beaming Mr. Vajpayee waving to motorists. As many as 600 such boards were put up at a cost of Rs.48 crore and later Rs.1.8 crore was spent for their removal. The EC asked the National Highways Authority of India to cover the boards as the model code did not allow display of hoardings paid for from the exchequer. The Opposition parties, led by the Congress, had complained that the boards gave the NDA unfair advantage at the public expense. The EC, which also heard a complaint seeking freezing of the BSPs symbol as elephant statues had been installed in parks and public places by spending the public money, rejected the plea after a detailed hearing. On the plea to freeze the elephant symbol, the EC said this question could be considered only if the model code was violated. It was well settled that the code would come into play only when the poll schedule was announced. If a party, whether ruling or in the Opposition, by misusing public funds for its own partisan ends, erects or installs statues of its party symbol, even during non-election period, the party cannot absolve itself of the accusation that it has acted in breach of salutary principles underlying the objects of the code  maybe not in letter, but undoubtedly in spirit, the EC had ruled then. As of now we cannot do anything even if it is proved that the structure is the symbol of AIADMKModel code and other restrictions on campaigning will be in force only when election is announced As of now we cannot do anything even if it is proved that the structure is the symbol of AIADMK Model code and other restrictions on campaigning will be in force only when election is announced  OPEN",

        "content": " Yet another instance of terror funding through the supply of party pills has surfaced, with the seizure of 160 kg of precursor pseudoephedrine tablets by the Delhi Police Special Cell, believed to be intended for supply to units operating in Myanmar, which reportedly manufacture party pills like ice to cater to a huge demand in the international market. Three persons, including an alleged conduit of a Manipur-based banned outfit, have been arrested. The initial information on the narco-terror network were received by the Special Cell sleuths, when they learnt that some persons from Manipur were smuggling narcotics, particularly the precursor chemical to methamphetamine, which is commonly known as party pill meth, ice, or crystal. Investigations by a team comprising three inspectors revealed that the consignments were being supplied allegedly at the instance of Khumanba, a top commander of the banned terror outfit Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup of Manipur. He was allegedly controlling the supply chain through one John Lalmingthanga (35), who the police learnt had stocked a large consignment at a Janakpuri flat in West Delhi. The narcotic and controlled substances were being stored and transported for supply to Myanmar and China via Manipur, said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell), Sanjiv Yadav. Acting on information that John would hand a consignment to an accomplice at Janakpuri, the police laid a trap on Thursday and arrested him, along with one Ashem Danny Singh (32). We seized from them pure pseudoephedrine in the form of tablets in five cardboard boxes, weighing more than 100 kg, said Mr. Yadav. At their instance, the police raided the storehouse and seized seven lakh more tablets, weighing 60 kg, each containing 80 per cent of the precursor chemical, besides shipping material and 10 bags of empty bubble foil for the pills. The third accused, named Lalawmpuia (27), was also arrested. John, an ex-serviceman from Assam Rifles, who belongs to Manipur, had been living in Safdarjung Enclave. He quit his job in 2008, shifted to the Capital, and started dealing in second-hand vehicles, and also ran some food-stalls. In due course, he got initiated into the party pill trade at the instance of a cousin, who is also allegedly into such trafficking business in Manipur. His accomplice, Ashem, also from Manipur, earlier worked as a teacher at home. He shifted to Delhi in 2002, and allegedly started working as a tout, facilitating government contracts for his clients. John allegedly took him into the business in September, to exploit his contacts with party pill distributers in Delhi. The accused, Lalawmpuia, who belongs to Mizoram, worked at a call centre in neighbouring Gurgaon, and had provided his rented accommodation to John to stock the consignments, said the police. Mr. Yadav said the accused were procuring the consignments from pharmaceutical factories in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi through local distributors. The pills were reprocessed to extract pure pseudoephedrine, which was transported to Myanmar for the manufacturing of methamphetamine, he added.

Justice V.K. Jain passed the order on a suit filed by the Society against D.P.S. Trust accusing the latter of misusing the name of its school Delhi Public School, the logo and the trademark to deceive people that the school run by it was affiliated to the original school. Justice Jain passed an ex-parte order as the D.P.S. Trust failed to appear in the Court to defend itself. I.. pass a decree for recovery of Rs.10 lakh as punitive damages in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant, Justice Jain said in his order. Holding the defendant guilty of infringement of the trademark, logo and name of the school, Justice Jain said: The defendant is running a school using the highly reputed brand name of Delhi Public School. The use of the name Delhi Public School, the word mark DPS and the logo of the plaintiff is dishonest, actuated with greed to cash in on the brand equity which these names enjoy among the parents in this country. On account of dishonest use of the trademark and logo of the plaintiff by the defendant, some innocent and gullible parents may admit their wards in the schools being run by the defendant and pay high fees and other charges which they would not pay for admission in an obscure school, under a mistaken belief that their child is studying in one of the schools being run by the plaintiff, Justice Jain said. It is, therefore, necessary to award adequate punitive damages to the plaintiff so that such dishonest tendencies may be curbed and innocent parents are not trapped into admitting their wards in schools such as the school being run by the defendant, Justice Jain added. For the reasons stated hereinabove, a decree for perpetual injunction with costs is hereby passed restraining the defendant from using the registered logo, registered trademark DPS as well as the name Delhi Public School of the plaintiff Society for running a school or providing education related services, Justice Jain stated. The defendant is further restrained from offering, promoting or advertising any school or education related services under the above-referred name or trademark or any other name or trademark which is identical or deceptively similar to the trademarks DPS and Delhi Public School or the logo of the plaintiff Society, Justice further stated.

        "content": " On December 10 and 11 when Google and Facebook went offline, users must have felt like Tom Hanks in Cast Away , abandoned alone on an island. Although the outage lasted only 20 minutes in the case of Google, and a few hours in the case of Facebook, panic and frustration were palpable on Twitter, with #googledown gaining traction within minutes of the outages. These were not part of any orchestrated anonymous attacks, or, as a few witty tweeters put it, symptoms of the apocalypse, or of the world going down action due later this December. Googles outage led to some of its widely used non-search applications such as mail, chat and other cloud-based services going offline. Facebooks followed, going down for a few hours. Separate infrastructure glitches caused these outages  a buggy software update in case of Google, and Web address translation problem associated with the DNS (Domain Name System) for Facebook. Although these glitches were not catastrophic in terms of loss of data, they served Internet users another warning against blindly succumbing to the pious platitudes and wholesale endorsements of cloud computing as the next big wave on the Internet. The hardware hurdle Soon after the outage, Google promptly reported on the cause of the problem and the actions that it took, in a report published on the Google Apps dashboard. A bug in a load balancing software update caused the temporary outage of Google services, it said. When more than one server is catering to user requests, which is certainly the case when Google is serving content via thousands of servers from hundreds of locations, there is a necessity to balance the load (user requests) on each of the servers. To expose a single server to bombardments of requests, leaving others lazing would deem to be poor network design. The arbitration mechanism used to balance the load between servers and server farms, using intelligent programmes running on powerful switching computers, is server load balancing. Software updates need to run regularly in order to accommodate modifications in the server infrastructure. Google engineers located the 18-minute service outage to a bug in the software that ran on some Google applications. This glitch had affected Google Mail, Chat, Google Drive and the Chrome browsers. But Googles kingpin, its search engine, was immune to this problem. Facebook, however, ran into a more mundane problem that websites often face. Facebook spokesperson cited Domain Name System infrastructure changes that were carried out, to be the reason for the temporary unavailability of the social networking site. DNS is the telephone directory look-up equivalent for translating textual Web address to numeric server addresses (IP address). It is the first, and the most important, step to allow clients to reach the servers. When this look-up fails, the website remains inaccessible. The DNS server reconfiguration seemed to have affected Facebook on the desktop version; the mobile version escaped the problem. When users put all their apples on the cloud, as they increasingly do, these infrastructural inconsistencies can have a dramatic cascading effect. Although Google, Facebook and most cloud service providers claim that they have built in multiple levels of redundancies into their infrastructure, the latest outage is yet another example of how millions of users data remains vulnerable to the vicissitudes of global networks. Of course, it would be wrong to attribute the outages at Google or Facebook to technical incompetence. But surely they are pointers to the risks in putting everything on the cloud, and not anywhere else. Security and privacy Reliability is an additional concern to widespread implementation of the cloud. There is already a raging debate on issues such as security and privacy on the cloud. Critics of the wholesale movement to the cloud argue that the world has not yet reached a stage where cloud computing has become inevitable. Regular incidents of user accounts being wiped off, or hijacked due to weaknesses in the authentication mechanisms of major cloud service providers are certainly discouraging users to bet solely on the cloud. Security threats in cloud-based services do not just imply lacunae in the cloud infrastructure, but also the hesitation of service providers in admitting that the security is not foolproof. Without this emphasis, users tend to set easy-to-guess passwords, or common passwords between multiple accounts, aggravating the already-existing security flaws. In conventional websites, that are not cloud-based, if unauthorised access is gained to a users account, the cracker in most cases would reach a dead end and be unable to invade other accounts of the user; it would also be virtually impossible for him to reach the users local drives. The daisy chaining of accounts on the cloud, however, results in a lower-level of protection. The clouds USP is built on the promise: Take your data wherever you go. But the downside risk is that like the domino effect, it can bring down much more when compared to its terra firma counterpart. Most cloud-based storage applications, for instance, allow applications to directly access user data on their hard drive, between multiple devices such as smartphones, tablet computers and desktop computers. Breaking into one of these devices implies access to all other connected devices. By signing on to user agreements, they agree that they will remain continuously tracked, and on logs maintained by the cloud-service providers. Privacy is simply absent on the cloud. The hype about the revolutionary potential of the cloud has been tempered by the realisation that its reliability is still not iron-clad. If anything, the recent outages highlight the need for users to spread their risks across multiple service providers instead of putting everything on a single cloud.

But she did not return home, perhaps joining the growing number of children taken away for arms training by militants across the international border. Pleading Her mother, Premkumari Laishram, told journalists that Babina managed to call the relatives up from the border town of Moreh and informed them that she was kept somewhere along the Moreh river, pleading with them to save her. On the night of June 13, a man, claiming to be an insurgent, informed the family that the girl was in the custody of the outfit, she would soon be sent out for training, and they could meet her after three months. But James Khaidem, 15, and Vijakumar Oinam, 17, were lucky. They were rescued by police commandos in Thoubal district on June 14, while being taken to Myanmar in a van by two insurgents for conscription into a faction of the Kangleipak Communist Party. The boys were promised Rs.1,50,000 each on arrival along the international border. On March 10, Alice Kamei and Sanahanbi Khaidem were lured by a banned outfit out of their hostel in Bishnupur district. While the parents of Khaidem did not protest, student and youth organisations of the Zeliangrong tribe launched a protest, as Kamei belongs to the tribe. However, the outfit claimed that the girls had joined up on their own.  The number of children abducted by militants is growing.  OPEN",

Two meetings were held and a rally was taken out in the city to protest the illegal' sentence to a doctor who has dedicated almost his entire professional career to the treatment of children of poor and illiterate tribespeople living in Chattisgarh's forests as well as to the human rights of the poor. In the morning, the National Alliance of People's Movements (NAPM) took out a rally of social activists from several organisations, writers and artists to the High Court Junction seeking justice for Binayak Sen who is also one of the frontline leaders of NAPM and People's Union of Civil Liberties. Dominic Presentation, MLA, flagged off the rally. Sebastian Paul, former, MP, who opened the meeting, said the verdict against Dr. Sen was unjust and cruel.' He said there was a strong tendency in contemporary India to brand human rights activists as terrorists and anti-nationals. Where human rights were not respected and protected, democracy would be in peril, he warned. C.R. Neelakantan, environmental and social activist, said what Dr. Sen was a victim of miscarriage of justice.' Both the evidence against him and the judgment were weak'. The court had taken a maximalist approach to the charge of sedition against Dr. Sen, he said. In the afternoon, a protest meeting was organised by the Binayak Sen Solidarity Forum. Speakers at the meeting alleged that Dr. Sen had been targeted by the establishment for long. He had helped the marginalised and illiterate tribespeople to stand up for their rights and was hence dubbed a Maoist sympathiser. The meeting also paid homage to the memory of PUCL leader K.G. Kannabiran who died recently. Dr. Sen has dedicated his professional career to the treatment of poor children.  OPEN",

Soju, prime accused in the September 4 murder of tipper lorry driver Saji here, was absconding for the past two months. He was arrested by a special team headed by Fort Assistant Commissioner K.S. Suresh Kumar and which included inspectors Sheen Tharayil, R. Shivkumar, K.V. Ramanan, Sreekumar, S. Suresh and Hemant Hasan. The police were on the lookout for Soju in the State and outside after the murder. The team was stationed in Delhi and Rajasthan for more than two months looking for leads in the case before arresting Soju from his hideout at one of the dargahs. ATM transactions made by Soju led the police to his hideout, City Police Commissioner T.J. Jose said at a press meet here on Wednesday. Feud led to murder Soju, 35, was absconding after the murder of Saji, an associate of Choozhattukotta Ambili, another goon in the district and rival of Soju, at Nedumkad, near Karamana, here in September. Saji was hacked to death by Sojus gang following a gangland feud. Soju was arrested in February this year under the Kerala Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act. The attack on Saji was carried out after his release. Soju is the prime accused in the murder of two other alleged gangsters Jet Santhosh and Parassala Binu. As many 23 cases, including those related to chain-snatching and kidnapping, are registered against him in various police stations in the district. Mr. Jose said the police team would be rewarded.

The men, 16 from Punjab and one from Haryana, were awarded the sentence in March this year by a Sharjah court, which found them guilty for the murder of Misri Nazir Khan near a Sharjah labour camp, over a bootlegging dispute in January 2009. Blood money Blood money is paid to the next of kin of a murder victim as a fine. Lawyer for the Indians, Bindu Suresh Chettur, said, The family of the Pakistani man told the court that they were ready to accept compensation, including blood money, but we refused because justice is on our side. The prosecution has failed to establish the relationship between the offence, the weapon with which the crime was committed and the scene of the crime. No evidence has yet been brought before us, she told PTI after a hearing yesterday. According to her, the evidence could not be accepted as no weapon had yet been presented before the court. Duty of prosecution It is the duty of the prosecution to ensure that the weapon which was used to commit the crime is presented before the court. That hasn't happened in the several hearings, she said. The court has fixed February 17 as the next date of hearing, during which more witnesses have been summoned. During the last hearing in the Sharjah Appeals Court on December 17, the prosecution failed to materialise the evidence to be cross-examined. Police not present Instead, a CD containing the reconstruction of the scene of the crime was provided. Police officials who were supposed to be present in the court did not show up. The court has asked the prosecution to ensure the presence of witnesses, including the Sharjah police personnel who prepared the report that formed the basis of conviction. The Indian government has expressed concern over the death sentence. It had asked its Mission in Dubai to engage the services of a leading legal firm to defend the accused.

The booths at Muttlupady and Konkanarabettu were provided tight security. Polling was brisk at the booths in the naxal-affected areas because most of the voters were farm workers.

Boycott threat Though there were calls to boycott elections in some areas in Kundapur and Karkala taluks, the district administration convinced the people to exercise their franchise.

At Honnalli and Devarakallalli in Hasanagi gram panchayat area in Yellapur taluk, a large number voters, mostly women from backward classes, did not show interest in voting because they were not given wages for work under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme by the gram panchayat. They staged a dharna in front of the polling booth. At Nidgod in Siddapur taluk, voting was held up for some time owing to a snag in the voting machine.  OPEN",

A sitting Judge should conduct the probe, the organisations demanded. A.Marx, president, People's Union for Human Rights (PUHR), and G.Sukumaran, secretary, Federation for People's Rights, Puducherry, told presspersons here on Tuesday that nearly 2,000 narikuravas lived at Muthuveerkavundanpatti, Manojipatti, Guruvadipatti, Reddypalayam road, Annai Sivakami Nagar, Mariamman Koil, Ammanpettai and Avarampatti. They were put to a lot of harassment by the police and they were arrested and false cases were foisted on them, they alleged. To protest this, 80 women of these villages launched an indefinite fast recently at Manojipatti. On request from Vivekanandan, advocate and a member of VCK, a fact finding committee comprising human rights activists visited these villages and collected first hand information. Selvarani, wife of Veeraiyan of Muthuveerakavundanpatti, and Murugayi, wife of Rajani, narrated their tales of sorrow. They explained about alleged police harassment and the number of cases foisted on their husbands and fathers. Unable to tolerate the alleged harassment by police, Selvarani allegedly used kerosene to immolate herself. She suffered 50 per cent burns but survived after treatment, Mr.Marx and Mr.Sukumaran alleged. Collector K.Baskaran told the fact finding committee that an inquiry by Revenue Divisional Officer has been ordered into the allegations. But Mr. Marx and Mr. Sukumaran said that the RDO inquiry was not enough. A judicial probe should be ordered. The narikuravas mentioned the names of certain police officers who they alleged foisted cases on them. Action should be taken against them, they demanded. Narikuravas have been facing the problem of getting caste certificate and many of the government schemes did not reach them. District administration should look into this matter and action should be taken on the allegations as the tribal community is facing the danger of being linked to crimes and made a notified community, they alleged. Besides Mr.Marx and Mr.Sukumaran, the fact finding committee comprised Aranga.Gunasekaran of Thamizhaga Manitha Urimai Kazhagam, Peravurani, Prof. Prabha Kalvimani, Pazhangudi Irular Padukappu Sangam, M.Sivagurunathan, Makkal Kazhagam for Human rights, Tiruvarur and Prof.C.Subramanian of Thanjavur.

        "content": " Russia and India should speed up work on their joint fifth-generation fighter plane to meet the challenge from the Chinese rival unveiled earlier this week, said a leading military expert. The Chinese prototype of a fifth-generation aircraft, J-20, appears to be a long-range strike aircraft and as such it will pose a potential threat to India, said analyst Konstantin Makienko of the Moscow-based Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (CAST). China's stealth fighter made its first 15-minute flight on Tuesday over an airfield in the south-western city of Chengdu. Mr. Makienko called the test flight an unquestionable success for the Chinese defence industry. China has emerged as the third nation developing the fifth-generation fighter plane after the U.S. and Russia, he told The Hindu. The J-20 fighter will be a direct rival of the Russian-Indian fifth-generation aircraft. The Chinese plane will be ready by 2020, so time will be a crucial factor. The Russian prototype, T-50, made its first flight a year ago. India joined the project only last month when the two sides signed a contract for the preliminary design of the fifth-generation fighter aircraft to be called Perspective Multi-role Fighter (PMF). India will contribute about 30 per cent of the plane's total design by providing composite material components, some avionics, electronic warfare systems and cockpit displays. Indian designers will also be responsible for re-modelling Russia's single-seat fighter into a two-seater version for the IAF. The PMF planes are expected to start rolling out around 2017. The fifth-generation fighter will be the first Indo-Russian aviation project that will be marketed in third countries. The Russian Center for Analysis of International Weapons Trade estimates the global market for the PMF at over 400 planes.

The move comes despite Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali's announcement during a late night televised address on Thursday that he would step down from his post in 2014 and push for greater freedoms and reforms. The Tunisian opposition had welcomed the presidential address, but there were enough skeptics among the country's opinion makers who either counselled a wait-and-see approach or called for an escalation of protests. Despite Mr. Ben Ali's olive branch, fresh demonstrations erupted on Friday in Tunis and in other parts. Police clashed heavily with angry protesters outside the Interior Ministry headquarters in Tunis. Gunshots were heard and police struck with teargas grenades. In the western city of Sidi Bouzid, the origin of nearly month long protests, thousands chanted Ben Ali out, the agency said. Rioting has been rife in Tunisia for nearly a month after an unemployed educated youth driven to selling vegetables set himself ablaze after officials prevented him from pursuing his trade. Apart from surging food prices, the denial of civil liberties and tainted elections has left a deep seated reservoir of discontent among various sections of the people, analysts say. Sixty-six people have died since the protests began, the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights has tallied. Of these seven committed suicide in the wake of heavy unemployment and economic difficulties. The Lebanese daily in Arabic, Al Akhbar has reported that ahead of Mr. Ben Ali's address, cracks had begun to emerge in the Tunisian military. The daily said Tunisian Joint Chiefs of Staff General Rashid Ammar, who was subsequently sacked, had on Wednesday refused to order the Army to use force against the protestors. In his address Mr. Ben Ali, who has been in power for 23 years, said he would not seek re-election in 2014.  OPEN",

The journalist, Wali Khan Babar, who used to work with Geo News channel of the Jang Group, was gunned down on Thursday night in what is being billed as a target killing. A Pashtun, Mr. Babar was apparently gunned down near his home. According to the MQM, within hours of this killing there were attacks on Urdu-speaking people across the commercial capital of Pakistan. The city, which has seen considerable bloodletting over the past couple of years as a result of this turf battle between the MQM and the ANP, is increasingly being divided along ethnic lines  Urdu-speaking versus the Pashtuns who have moved into Karachi in large numbers in search of a livelihood. Amid reports of targeted shootings from various parts of the city, leaders of both political parties held press conferences to trade charges against each other and demand a proper enquiry into this latest spate of violence. A separate enquiry has, meanwhile, been instituted into Babar's murder. In a related development, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) described Mr. Babar's killing as a premeditated murder and demanded a full investigation. Referring to the latest spree of violence in Karachi, the HRCP statement said: This recurring pattern of death is a stark negation of the most basic rights that the state is under an obligation to protect.The task of the law enforcement agencies must be more than merely delivering dead bodies and injured to hospitals and claiming to be on high security alerts after the fact. Policewoman killed A policewoman who had been receiving threats from the Taliban was killed along with five of her family members in a pre-dawn attack by heavy weapon-wielding terrorists on her house in the Hangu area of Khyber-Pukhtoonkhwa on Friday. The head constable, Shamshad Begum, was under pressure from the Taliban, which frequently attacks girls schools in the province as part of its avowed agenda against girl's education, to quit her job. She was killed along with three of her children and two sisters-in-law. Three other children of the policewoman sustained injuries. The terrorists stormed her house using rockets and, according to the police, fired indiscriminately killing and injuring practically everyone who came their way.   OPEN",

Chennai Suburban Police Commissioner S. R. Jangid told mediapersons on Thursday that a team of PEW personnel intercepted Jayaraman of Madambakkam near Tambaram while he was travelling on a two-wheeler with a bag of fake caps. His interrogation led the policemen to a factory in Tirumazhisai where they recovered several hundred more such fake caps of many IMFL brands. The company's owner Nabu Lal and his son Rajesh had permission for an aluminum fabrication unit, but as the company started incurring losses they started making these caps after coming in contact with Jayaraman. Two more men who helped them were also arrested. Nabu Lal received Rs.550 for every kg of fake caps, which were sold in different parts of the State to those involved in adulterating liquor. The police have launched a search for those involved in the adulteration. In similar raids at Athipattu Main Road in Ambattur and Kamaraj Nagar in Avadi, police recovered a huge quantity of spurious liquor hidden in the houses of two men  D. Ashok and B. Balasubramani. They would smuggle liquor from Puducherry and adulterate or simply dilute it. They had planned to sell them in illegal bars attached to government liquor outlets during the Pongal festival season, when the TASMAC shops get more than the usual number of customers.

Ms. Kaur, accompanied by Sarabjits elder daughter Swapandeep Kaur and Punjabi filmmaker Surinder Rehal, told journalists here on Friday that while she could not reveal the names of Pakistani officials who assured her of his release, her optimism increased after meeting Congress president Sonia Gandhi and other national leaders. She said the Pakistan government could release Sarabjit, along with many other prisoners, as part of a measure of clemency it has announced. In a goodwill gesture, she was posting rakhis to Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari and the Governor of Pakistans Punjab province, besides one to her brother, Ms. Kaur said. The family hoped that Sarabjit, who was recently granted presidential pardon after being on death row for almost 20 years, would celebrate Diwali at home, even if he could not return by Rakshabandhan, which falls on August 2. Ms. Kaur countered a statement of Surjeet Singh, a former spy who was repatriated recently, that Sarabjit was also involved in espionage, and that the condition in Pakistani prisons was good. Unlike Surjeet, who received Rs. 5 lakh from Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, Sarabjits family got nothing, she said. His wife was still in a temporary job on a salary of Rs.2,700; the State government was yet to place Swapandeep Kaur in a suitable job, despite an assurance it made five years ago.   OPEN",

Holding placards which said Stop Genocide of Hindus in Pakistan, We want Peace, the peace marchers, including girls and young boys, raised slogans against the government of Pakistan and Bangladesh. Nuzhat, a Jamia Millia Islamia student who was part of the vigil, said: Muslims in India are quite concerned about what is happening in Pakistan and Bangladesh. We condemn the attacks in the strongest possible terms and demand that the governments of the two countries should bring the perpetrators to book and ensure that the minorities remain safe and secured. Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI) has also expressed concern over the cases of violence against Christians in Lahore last Saturday after an alleged blasphemy row. Expressing solidarity with the members of the minority community, the CBCI asked the Pakistani Prime Minister to ensure the perpetrators are brought to book. In a statement the religious body highlighted the growing trend of attacks on Christians in Pakistan. It is quite distressing to note that in recent years, attacks on Christians, in several parts of Pakistan are on the increase and there is a growing sense of insecurity among them. Under the pretext of alleged blasphemy, organised crime and violence are let loose by cynical mobs, causing heavy loss of life and damage to property, the CBCI statement said.   OPEN",

Mr. Antony said additional funds would be released by the Centre depending on the requirement of the State.He was countered by the BJP which alleged that the funds had not reached Uttarakhand as yet. A Cabinet Committee, headed by the Prime Minister, was set up to provide guidelines for expeditious reconstruction and rehabilitation measures. An Inter-Ministerial Group has also been established to draw up a time-bound action plan, the statement added. Mr. Antony assured the House that the Centre would continue to support the State government for long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction and ensure that the State was better equipped to handle such crises. It had been decided that the Uttarakhand issue would be the first to be taken up for discussion in the House, the Speaker said.  The Defence Minister also mentioned five IAF personnel, nine of the National Disaster Response Force, and six ITBP personnel, besides two pilots, who had lost their lives in a helicopter crash during rescue operations. The region will long remember the heroic commitment and courage displayed by our armed forces and police forces, as well as a large number civilian officials, residents and tourists who contributed towards rescue operations , he said.

Speaking after a mass held in Ms. Saldanhas memory at Westminster Cathedral in central London, the three struggled to suppress their tears as they described how their lives had been shattered and their once-happy home was now an empty dwelling without her presence. We love you Mum, sleep in peace and please watch over us until we meet again in Heaven. We will always love you and keep you close to our hearts, said 14-year-old Lisha as her father standing next to her wiped his tears. Junal (16) described his mother as having been the core of the family that kept us together. You taught us right from wrong which we appreciate. You worked tirelessly to give us everything that we have today. My wife, you were the light in my darkness, who always showed me the way forward. From the day we met, you always stood by me in times of hardship and happiness. I feel a part of me has been ripped out. In a joint tribute read out at the mass, the family described her as kind-hearted, generous and well-respected. A memorial mass was also held in Bristol where the family lived. He thanked all those who had offered support and comfort, including Prime Minister David Cameron, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and MPs Keith Vaz and Charlotte Leslie. Ms. Saldanha (46), who worked at Londons Edward VII hospital, committed suicide last week  three days after being duped by a hoax call that led to the confidential medical details of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Williams, being unwittingly revealed to two Australian radio presenters posing as the Queen and Prince Charles. She left three notes, one of which contained criticism of the hospital staff. The hospital insisted she was given full support after the incident.  OPEN",

The image was uploaded by friends of the girls, one a Singapore citizen on a visit and the other a design student from Bangalore. The incident took place on Saturday near the Raheja Arcade in Koramangala 3rd Block, where two youths on a motorbike made rude and abusive gestures at the two girls  both in their 20s  who were crossing the road. The girls friend, Akshay Kingar, immediately clicked a picture of the two riders along with the licence plate of their bike. Outraged citizens Within hours of the image being posted on the Facebook page, it drew outraged comments from citizens who supported the girls and their quick-thinking friend. The post gathered 10,000 likes and about 3,000 shares in just 24 hours. A Facebook group, The Bangalore Doers , was created as a platform to support and encourage victims of such incidents and also to help put a stop to them. On Wednesday, there was a response from the Bangalore Traffic Police saying they had the two young men in their custody. Speaking to The Hindu, the Singapore national said: We were attending an event in Koramanagala and crossing the road when the boys, who had stopped at a traffic signal, leered and made kissing noises at us and sped away. But not before giving them the finger. The only thing we managed to do was to take a picture of them before they escaped, she said. She said she was surprised that such passes were made in broad daylight in upmarket Koramangala. At that point of time, I felt scared and was very glad to have my friends with me. I dont think any kind of harassment (physical, verbal or even through gestures) must be tolerated. Allowing such small things to continue may lead to bigger problems. Encouraged by the response on Facebook, Mr. Kingar lodged a complaint with the Koramangala police on Monday. He admitted he did not expect the kind of response the image evoked. It was overwhelming with so many citizens backing us. It is not that I want these boys to be beaten up but I would want them to apologise to my friends. I would look at it as an opportunity to bring about social change rather than view it as a crime. Commerce students The Koramangala police said they detained both the youths on Wednesday for several hours for questioning. We have called the complainant as well. Both the boys are B.Com students of private colleges here and aged 21 and 22. They were let off later. They have been charged for eve-teasing under the Karnataka Police Act.  OPEN",

        "content": " Dasappa Shetty (62) never thought that an allegation of misbehaviour in the presence of his superiors would set him on an endless legal battle he can ill afford. This retired Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) conductor has fought a case against his dismissal order for 13 years and continues to do so, with no end in sight. The litigation has, literally, been taking him circles, from one court of law to another. The nightmare began for Dasappa Shetty in 1989, when he was charged with creating a bad scene in the depot by the manager at Chikmagalur. The alleged scene happened when he had gone in a delegation to meet the manager as a member of the KSRTC Staff and Workers' Union. An inquiry was ordered and the report submitted after seven years in 1996. Mr. Shetty's dismissal was ordered in September 1997, which he challenged in the Labour Court in Chikmagalur. The court in 1998 held that the dismissal was proper. It passed an award in September 2000 rejecting his claims of relief. Mr. Shetty then filed a writ petition against this in the Karnataka High Court in 2001. The single-judge bench quashed the order of the Labour Court in 2006 and ordered his reinstatement with 50 per cent back wages. The management went on a writ appeal, which was dismissed by a division bench in 2007. Then, the management filed a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court in 2007. The Supreme Court in 2008 set aside the High Court order and remanded it back to them for a fresh decision. The High Court, as it had done on an earlier occasion, set aside the order of the Labour Court in September 2009. Matters did not end there, because the High Court remanded the case back to the Labour Court for a fresh disposal. This in effect meant that the case had come full circle a decade later to where it began at the Labour Court in Chikmagalur. In January 2010, the Labour Court passed an order setting aside Mr. Shetty's dismissal and ordered that 50 p.c. of back wages be given to him from 1997. Yet another cycle of litigation has begun, with the management filing a writ petition in May 2010 in the High Court against the Labour Court's decision. The case is pending hearing. Mr. Shetty, who joined the KSRTC in 1973, retired in October 2006. This is an instance of how a management persecutes' an ordinary worker by dragging him through endless litigation, alleged H.V. Ananthasubba Rao, General Secretary of All India Trade Union Congress, Karnataka.  OPEN",

        "content": " The Kerala High Court wanted to know on Thursday whether or not the Makarajyothi' is a man-made phenomenon, amid a renewed debate in the wake of the stampede that killed 102 pilgrims last week on the authenticity of the hallowed celestial light visible from Sabarimala. The court's poser to the board managing the Sabarimala hill shrine came even as Kerala's Left Democratic Front government declined to be drawn into the debate. It said it did not intend to probe the Makarajyothi issue as it concerned the faith of millions of people. The court posed the question to Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) senior counsel T.G. Paraneshwar Nair after the reports filed by Kerala DGP, the Forest Department and the TDB on the Pulmedu tragedy came up before it. In the worst-ever disaster to strike the Sabarimala pilgrimage, 102 persons died in the stampede in the forested area of Pulmedu near the hill shrine when they were returning home after witnessing the Makarajyothi.' The beacon that fleetingly appears at dusk on January 14 marks the climax of the two-month Makaravilakku' season from mid-November at Sabarimala. The light flickers across the skies above Ponnambalamedu, east of Sabarimala shrine, during the Makarasamkramam' pooja. Mr. Nair told the bench comprising Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan and Justice P.S. Gopinathan that Makarajyothi' was a celestial star, considered divine. The board, however, had not given any publicity that it was divine,' he stated. People should know what is what, the court said and asked TDB to clarify this aspect. In view of the court's poser, the TDB had decided to call a meeting of high priests, religious scholars and authorities on temple customs and rituals to discuss the issue, its spokesman said. Probe ruled out Kerala Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan, meanwhile, ruled out a probe into the authenticity of the Makarajyothi.' Speaking to reporters in Thiruvananthapuram, he said the government would not inquire if it was a divine or a man-made phenomenon as the issue was essentially a matter of faith for millions. The government is going to consult neither astrologers nor scientists to ascertain the veracity of the Makarajyothi, which millions believe is divine, he said. Jyoti' and Vilakku' Rationalists have for long alleged that the Jyothi is a fire arranged by the temple authorities and government agencies. Giving some credence to the views of the sceptics, the senior most member among the Sabarimala high priests had said the flash of light appearing above the Ponnambalamedu shrine was a manmade fire. He said it was unfortunate that this had become a topic of controversy. A distinction has to be made between the Makaravilakku and Makarajyothi. The Jyothi is a celestial star. Makarvilakku is lit [by people],' said the head of the Thazamon Thanthri family, Kantararu Maheswararu. Kerala's Cooperation Minister G. Sudhakaran, who handled the Temple Affairs portfolio in the past, endorsed the Chief Minister's view. It is a solemn occurrence which does not pose harm to anybody. There has never been a communal division or ill-will over it. I don't think it is necessary to start an argument for and against it, he said. Mr. Sudhakaran, who was in charge when controversies such as South Indian actress Jayamala's claim of having visited the hill shrine in violation of customs arose, however, said the information he had was that the Jyothi was lit by tribals as part of their tradition and belief. Adding a new dimension, Rahul Eswar, a member of the family of high priests of Sabarimala, said the light was man-lit while the actual Makarajyothi was a bright star that ascends the skies on Makarasamkramam, the time when the Sun moves from dhanu rasi' (Sagittarius sign) to Makaram rasi' (Capricorn).

        "content": " In a surprise development, the Gujarat Government's legal department has issued a revised order withholding transfers of 11 judicial officers, including the two presiding officers of the special courts hearing the 2002 communal riot cases. The revised order, the government sources said, was issued at the behest of the Gujarat High Court. At the recommendation of the High Court, the transfer orders were issued to 11 judicial officers on Thursday, including Mr M. H. Shah, who was functioning as the Secretary of the legal department of the State government. The reason for withholding the transfers, at least for the time being, was not immediately known. The sources said the revised order said all the transfers should be kept pending till January 14 and all the transferred judges would continue to function at the same place till further orders. The transfer orders had baffled the legal experts because it included the judges hearing the two most heinous massacres of 2002, Gulberg Society, where 69 people were burnt alive, and Naroda-Patia, which accounted for 96 deaths. The hearing in both the cases had reached almost the concluding stages and the legal experts feel that a change of the presiding officer at this stage could delay the final proceedings. The transfer of the controversial session judge, B. U. Joshi, who was hearing the Gulberg Society massacre case, had come as a great relief to many victims and the Mumbai-based voluntary organisation, the Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), which had been demanding a change of the judge accusing him of biased towards the accused. The High Court, which was earlier petitioned for a change after the principal sessions judge expressed his inability to make changes, had earlier rejected the demand of the CJP and the issue was pending in the Supreme Court. Mr. Joshi, who was transferred to Dahod, was earlier asked to hand over the charge of the Gulberg Society court by January 7 to his successor who was yet to be named. The judge of the special court hearing the Naroda-Patia massacre case, Jyotsnaben Yagnik, was transferred to Himmatnagar, the district headquarter of Sabarkantha, but for the time being would continue to function at the existing courts.

Addressing a session of MEDITEX 2012, a two-day conference organised here from Friday by the Indian Medical Association, Tamil Nadu, Project Director and Member Secretary of Tansacs, Kumar Jayant, said that after its launch in 2009, this public-private partnership initiative covered around 100 private hospitals. It now aimed at stepping up the private health sectors participation. Hospitals in the network would be provided HIV testing kits and consumables, delivery kits and training, free of cost, with the condition that the charges for tests should be Rs.75 only. All positive cases should be reported to the State government and linked up with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres for continued treatment. Another initiative to be launched was a new regimen aimed at preventing the transmission of HIV from positive pregnant mothers to children. While the chances of such transmission stood at 30 per cent without intervention, he said that the proposed measure would bring it down to less than five per cent. It involved administering ART drugs for up to 14 to 16 weeks to the mother right up to one week after she stopped breast feeding the baby. The new born would be given drugs for six weeks. Around 10.8 lakh pregnant women gave birth annually with 619 infants at risk of acquiring infection. Giving an overall picture of the HIV/AIDS scenario in Tamil Nadu, Mr. Jayant said that around 2.1 lakh HIV positive persons had registered themselves with the 49 ART centres in the State. From 0.65 per cent in 2004, HIV prevalence in Tamil Nadu declined to 0.33 per cent in 2009. A sample survey, conducted every two years, estimated that there were 1,169 positive cases last year. This figure was likely to be around 1,200 this year. This PPP initiative would help to cover those missed out by the government sector but were getting treatment from the private sector.  Mr. Jayant said the budget allocation for the health sector was increased by five per cent this year to Rs. 5,300 crore. A sum of Rs. 463 crore was being spent on the Chief Ministers Health Insurance Scheme under which 811 private medical institutions had enrolled.

Yeddyurappa. Visiting the area where work is in progress on Friday, the seer said: The Chief Minister promised me recently that nothing apart from 1,800 acres of land will be acquired. Accordingly, he gave instructions to the Deputy Commissioner. By going ahead with acquisition of more land, they have acted against the Chief Minister's promise. The seer said the Chief Minister might not be aware of acquisition of more land. I will draw the attention of the Chief Minister to this matter. I will announce my next step in Udupi on Saturday, he added. Meanwhile, Ramachandra Bhandarkar, public relations officer of MSEZL, said in a press release on Friday that four more acres of land had been acquired for road connectivity to the rehabilitation and resettlement colony and not for any industrial purpose. The land was notified in May 2007 and was acquired by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board during Phase I of land acquisition. Seventy of the 78 Kudubi families received compensation. Giriya Gowda and other Kudubis approached the High Court and their petition was dismissed in September, Mr. Bhandarkar said. Owing to heavy rain, we could not take up roadwork then. Now, to facilitate the bhandara movement of the 900-year-old deity Sri Kodamanithaya to Sri Somanatha Temple Permude, work is going on,'' he said.  OPEN",

        "content": " Several social and fishermen organisations have threatened to launch an agitation against handing over part of Karwar beach to the Indian Coast Guard. Representatives of about 10 organisations told presspersons here on Friday that when thousands of acres of unused acquired land was with the Ministry of Defence in Karwar, where was the need to handover the civilian area without bringing it to the notice of the citizens of Karwar? The representatives of the organisations said the assurance of Coast Guard that it would not disturb the tourists, beach lovers and fishermen from seeing the beach was a farce and a similar assurance was given to fishermen during the land acquisition for the Seabird. But now the situation was different. Even if the fishermen entered the Defence area by mistake, they were being beaten up, and their boats and the nets seized by the naval authorities, the leaders alleged. They said the Coast Guard would build a jetty for its ships in Karwar and it would definitely ban people from using the beach. The Coast Guard office should be based in Devabag or Kurmagad islands near Karwar in the mid sea. This would help the Coast Guard to protect the area more effectively. Because the 12 nautical miles (nM) from the coast was guarded by the coastal police, next 200 nM would be guarded by the Coast Guard and the internal national border by the Navy. What was the use of giving them the civilian area? The leaders demanded that the order of handing over a part of the beach should be cancelled immediately. In 1998, when the land in 13 villages of Karwar taluk was acquired for the project Seabird, an area between the Amadalli and Chendia village was marked for the Coast Guard. But the Coast Guard authorities did not want to stay in the rural areas and they brought pressure on the district administration for a prime land on Karwar beach, and some officials of the district administration succumbed to it, said the leaders. The leaders of Karnataka Rakshana Sangha, the Universal Welfare Society, Aligadda Koolikarmikara Sangha, the Janashakthi Vedike and student and fishermen unions were present.

The Centre seemed to have understood the importance of securing the country's coasts and accordingly initiated plans to set up more Coast Guard stations along the vast coastal line of the country including Karnataka and also to acquire more ships and patrol boats.

This was disclosed in an inquiry carried out by Vivek Agavane, Deputy Collector of Radhanagari in Kolhapur district. He has cancelled the names of Mohite-Patil's family members from the record of rights and 7/12 documents. According to the inquiry report, Karveer Peeth of Sankaracharya has 2,000 acres of land at Konoli in Kolhapur district. Out of that, ownership of 400 acres of land was changed allegedly with the connivance of the then revenue authorities. About 227 acres of land was then sold to family members of Mohite-Patil and the remaining land was sold to some other individuals. The allegedly illegal deal was done in 2007 and when Sankarachraya of Karveer Peeth came to know about the deal, a complaint was lodged with the then Revenue Minister Narayan Rane. Then the inquiry was ordered and Deputy Collector Vivek Agavane was entrusted with the task of carrying out detailed inquiry in the matter. It is said that the then tahsildar and seven talathis were involved in the deal and departmental inquiry was on against them. The Secretary of the Karveer Peeth of Shankaracharya, Ashok Baviskar, has confirmed about the inquiry report and said that the ownership of Karveer Peeth would now be recorded on the concerned lands.

Soon after the inaugural function organised to create awareness on the need to maintain the Phalguni and its surrounding clean, about 170 students of Ramakrishna College in the city began picking up plastic bags, plastic bottles and other waste accumulated on the banks of the Phalguni amid Kandla plants. The students were volunteers of the National Service Scheme (NSS) of the college. T.C. Shivashankara Murthy, Vice-Chancellor, Mangalore University, launched the awareness drive. The college, NSS unit of the university and Lions and Lioness Club Mangalore, Ashoknagar jointly organised the programme. While interacting informally with students, the Vice-Chancellor asked them to mitigate the use of plastics in their homes. He asked them if they came to clean the bank of the river voluntarily or by force. We came on our own, said the students. Mr. Murthy asked students to convince their family members to reduce the use of plastics at their homes. Earlier, after inaugurating the programme, the Vice-Chancellor said it might not be possible to ban using plastic completely. More awareness should be created to minimise its use. There was a need to manufacture eco-friendly plastics, he said. Jaya Kojapady, a local resident, said that the Phalguni was polluted so much that even dogs and cats refused to eat fish caught at Bangra Kuloor. Earlier, fishermen were supplying fish to the city caught at Bangra Kuloor, he said. Melwin D'Souza, who lives in the area, told The Hindu that some people dumped chicken waste in the river from the Gurupur bridge at night. It was going on unchecked, he alleged. Once we caught some persons pouring it from a tempo and warned. No use. It continues, he said. You please visit this place early morning to see how many plastic bags float in the river, he said.

But, she had the presence of mind to call her friend on her mobile to inform her that she was being abducted. Noticing this, the other man sitting next to the driver moved into the passenger compartment of the auto and tried to pin her to the seat to prevent her from using her phone and also to stop her from escaping. That was when the young software engineer, who works in a private firm, used the pepper spray and jumped out of the moving three-wheeler near DLF bus stop in Madhapur. She fell on her back and sustained a bleeding wound on the back of her head. Surprised passers-by, including a Wipro employee Naveen, tried to chase the auto, but the abductors managed to speed away. The woman was rushed to a private hospital. She was courageous, intelligent and took the bull by horns.

        "content": " In the aftermath of the Delhi gang rape incident, a multi-national BPO in Chennai issued a circular to all its employees. It was titled, Dress appropriately, Act modestly. In order to prevent sexual crimes, the first step has to be prevention, said a senior official of the company, explaining the circular. When instances of harassment do occur, warnings, counselling, transfers and in extreme cases, suspensions  are the ways we deal with them, says the official of the company which has 2,500 employees, of which 950 are women. 10 cases of sexual harassment were reported in the last five years, he added. The 20-year-old IT industry is often perceived as a safe one for women who form nearly 35 per cent of its workforce. But standards differ widely in the way cases of sexual harassment are handled in the industry.While bigger companies are strict about such cases, the smaller ones insist on nothing more than a written apology. Everything depends on the complaint and people concerned. Often, the woman asks for a transfer and it is granted, says Rashmi Nair, an HR consultant. In a company like HCL, for instance, the process is quite straightforward. You complain. The enquiry is conducted by a team not associated with your own and if the complaint is found to have substance, the offender is warned or suspended. The proceedings are kept so confidential that your own teammates dont know about it, says an employee. However, the case is the opposite with BPOs. The rules are hogwash, even in back-end offices of MNCs, says S. Manushree, a BPO worker. Another BPO employee says, My colleague would play an item song every time I walked in. I sought a change of seating. Now, he does the same at the coffee counter. Frequently complimenting someone on their clothes or talking about their body, to an extent that makes them uncomfortable, is the classic form of sexual harassment, adds Aarohi Sastri, country head (HR) of a pharma firm. Instances of harassment linked to career prospects abound. A manager in a manufacturing firm in Sriperumbudur recalls how her boss used to constantly tell her, be nice to me if you want me to be nice to you. It is easy to complain against your co-worker, but every woman thinks twice when the offender is her boss, she adds. Employees say that in the absence of institutions that deal with the issue, an arbitrary set of rules prevails. Most BPOs adopt policies adopted by their foreign clients. In our firm, a rule prohibits the gifting of sex toys to colleagues in office parties, during Thanksgiving. It is not even relevant here, and shows how little care goes into drafting policies, Sudha Narayanan, a programming assistant in a tech firm. Many rules are not enforced either. Many employees have pictures, obscene texts and even lewd signatures in their emails or as screensavers. They are warned if someone complains. There is no monitoring; so most of us learn to ignore them, says S. Swarnalakshmi, who works at Tidel Park. K. Purushottaman, regional director, NASSCOM, says the IT Industry has strived to introduce best practices to ensure a harassment-free environment.  Ensuring the safety of women is also important to project ourselves as the best choice for clients everywhere, he adds. However, employees are not entirely convinced; for instance, the fear of a complaint being termed malicious looms large. What if the offender got out by proving the victim wrong. More importantly, what if people who supported me initially, backed out, says Radha Sukumaran, a testing engineer. The way out often seems to ignore the harassment as much as you can, she adds.

Taking up an application seeking compensation to the deceased prisoners family, the NHRC has entrusted its own director general (DG) of investigation wing to conduct an enquiry into it and submit the report to the Commission within eight weeks. India Media Centre, a Puri-based NGO had approached the NHRC stating that the prisoner was murdered inside the jail premises when two other inmates fired at him. Shootout inside a jail speaks volumes about the poor law and order in the State and due to sheer negligence of the jail authorities, the prisoner was shot dead, said the petitioner advocate Nishikant Mishra and sought at least Rs. 5 lakh as damage to the family of the deceased. It may be recalled here that murder convict Dhaneswar Swain alias Kalia was shot dead by two other inmates of Bhanjanagar sub-jail after procuring a gun from outside. After firing at Kalia, the offendersBapi Mishra and Manoj Pradhan escaped from the prison. They were however, apprehended soon by the local police. In the meantime, the State government has put under suspensions three staff of the jail for dereliction of duties after it was revealed that three visitors had met Mishra and Pradhan during the visiting hours in jail and had handed over a sophisticated pistol to them.

In all, seven vehicles rigged with explosives went off in five cities south of Baghdad during morning rush hour, leaving 56 people wounded in primarily Shiite Muslim areas of Iraq. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Sunni militant groups linked to Al-Qaeda frequently target Shiites, whom they regard as apostates, in coordinated attacks. Car bombs went off in Kut, Aziziyah, Mahmudiyah, Nasiriyah and Basra, officials said.In Kut, provincial capital of Wasit and 160 kilometres south of Baghdad, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in an industrial area packed with vehicle repair garages, killing seven people and wounding 15. Another car bomb in nearby Aziziyah in the town's main marketplace and near a Shiite mosque killed five and wounded 10.Twin blasts in the southern port city of Basra, meanwhile, killed five people, including a bomb disposal expert looking to defuse one of the rigged vehicles. Three others were killed in bombings in Nasiriyah and Mahmudiyah.The violence was the latest in a spike in attacks nationwide, with last month registering the highest death toll since 2008, sparking fears of a return to the all-out sectarian war that blighted Iraq in 2006 and 2007.AFP  OPEN",

Statistics Police sources told The Hindu that the maximum of 245 persons (male-165, female-65, boys-5 and girls-10) consumed poison to end their lives, while 188 persons (male-132, female-42, boys-6 and girls-8) took the extreme step by hanging in houses. As many as 59 persons (male-17, female-38, and girls-4) had reportedly committed suicide by consuming cow dung powder though there was a ban on its sale existed in the district last year. Of the remaining, 43 persons ended their lives by self immolation and 30 by jumping into water bodies. K. Sakthivel, psychiatrist, District Headquarters Hospital, told The Hindu that suicide was high among migrant worker population owing to the stress they face and due to the vulnerable personality traits in them which lead them to end life even at the slightest of the provocations. The statistics indicate that the steps taken by the police and revenue administrations last year to bring down the suicide rate in the district, including setting up of suicide prevention cells and counselling, have not yielded the desired effect. Despite the high suicides in Tirupur became a national-level issue, the government hospitals in the district even now do not have adequate specialist psychologists and paramedical staff to attend to the patients.

Jaganmohan Reddy's revolt against the Congress high command, reached the zenith. Unfortunately, Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan was doing what Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy was supposed to do to tackle the crisis, Mr. Dattatreya said at a press conference here on Friday. Mr. Narasimhan even met members of the Central Core Committee exceeding his constitutional brief, he alleged, adding that as a result Raj Bhavan became a Congress Bhavan'. Mr. Dattatreya said the Chief Minister's separate meetings with Mr. Narasimhan, Praja Rajyam Party president K. Chiranjeevi and MIM leaders point to an impending constitutional crisis. The government was finding it extremely difficult to deal with the Telangana agitation on the one side andthe challenge thrown by Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy on the other. It had little time to solve people's problems, mainly the plight of rain-hit farmers, Mr. Dattatreya added. Unlike other Governors, Mr. Narasimhan was more active than the Chief Minister as the show was being run from Delhi, the senior BJP leader said. Since Mr. Narasimhan was acting as an extra-constitutional authority, he should be recalled immediately, Mr. Dattatreya said. Corruption Mr. Dattatreya said corruption was nurtured by the Central Government, which was also unable to control inflation. The popularity ratings of UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi and AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi obviously plummeted, he said, and added that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was a helpless man. Some of the UPA allies demanded that the 2G spectrum scandal be investigated by a JPC. Such was the extent of rot in the system, but the UPA was reluctant to crack the whip on wrongdoers due to political compulsions, Mr. Dattatreya said. BJP State vice-president Y. Raghunath Babu, district president Krupa Rao and others were present.

        "content": " Necessity is the mother of invention. In 1987, when there was acute water shortage, direct sowing  a new agriculture technology  was introduced. This time around when the standing samba crop is starving for water in the Cauvery delta districts, technology has once again come to the rescue. Large scale spraying of Pink-Pigmented Facultative Methylobacterium (PPFM) has been taken up in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Tiruchi, and Cuddalore under the samba package announced by the government to mitigate water stress in standing samba crops. Mass spraying has already begin in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts. T.Jayaraj, director, Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute (TRRI), Aduthurai, who is the nodal officer for the scheme, said the solution and potassium chloride sprayed with water at two per cent per acre would prevent evaporation of water from the crops by inducing the closure of stomata (holes in leaves). Because of this the crop will be able to survive for ten to 15 days in water starved condition. This is the only way out to save the crops which are in need of water. Jayaraj said. He also said that this is only a short-term temporary measure to save the crop. We expect rains in the third or last week of December he added. Government has cent per cent subsidised the scheme. This technology assumes importance as the standing samba paddy crop is in boot leaf stage (75 days before flowering) and flowering stage (80 days) after which panicle initiation would take place. This is a crucial stage and two are three wettings are needed. Till wetting is done, this technology will save the crop. When saved at this stage, samba may provide good yield to farmers. Earlier, a demonstration programme for farmers in using PPFM solution was organised at Sakkarasamantham village in Kalimedu panchayat near here on Friday. Hundreds of farmers were present at the programme that was inaugurated by S.Suresh Kumar, DRO, Thanjavur district.

        "content": " The Indian Lawyers' Congress (ILC) has called on political parties and other social and cultural organisations to raise their voice against the provisions in the Kerala Police Bill 2010 that is scheduled to be introduced in the Assembly soon. Terming sections in the Bill a threat to people's freedom and rights enshrined in the Constitution, the ILC said the Bill will turn the State into a police state. Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, ILC State president T. Asaf Ali said the Bill, in its present form, was against the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC) and the Supreme Court directives on police reforms. The State government should remove the anti-people sections in the Bill, he said. Though the House Select Committee had heard suggestions and recommendations from various organisations, including the ILC, in its hearings on the draft Bill and visited different States, including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Delhi, the final Bill being introduced in the Assembly had not made any major amendments in the draft Bill. He said the Bill would turn the police into a force of repression. Mr. Ali said Section 34 of the Bill says that a police officer is bound to take appropriate action on a complaint to the police provided the officer has no reason to suspect that the complaint is pseudonymous, anonymous or manifestly false or frivolous or trifling. He said this section was against the age-old Section 154 of the Cr.PC which says that every information relating to a cognizable offence, given orally or in writing, should be recorded and a copy of the recorded information be given to the informant. Section 34 in the Bill was illegal and would delay action against criminals, he added. Mr. Ali said Section 50 of the Bill which says that any person in police custody physically injured by application of force by a police officer should be taken to the nearest medical practitioner is contrary to Section 22(2) of the Constitution which mandates the police to produce before the magistrate any arrested person within 24 hours. If the Bill were to be passed, the police could justify torture and terror in police custody on the strength of a certificate issued by a private doctor. The magistrate would not be able to even see and hear from the accused on the nature of the latter's injuries and record the dying declaration of a seriously injured accused, he said.

        "content": " The gruesome death of four students, including two school kids , in a shocking accident caused due to footboard travel in a city bus in Chennai on December 10, has not only kicked up a lot of storm across the State, but has nudged the government to act on the matter . The incident raised so much concern that Madras High Court took suo motu cognisance and issued a host of instructions to curb the menace . The measures put forth by the High Court include stopping the buses and asking footboard travellers to get down if need be. If any student is found travelling on the footboard, the matter may be reported not only to the parents of the student concerned, but also to the principal of the educational institution and if he repeats the same , the school may take action for removing such students, after notice to the parent, the High Court said. Footboard travel is a serious issue and it has led to a number of accidents, many fatal. The State Express Transport Corporation buses and private buses with doors that could be closed do not face the problem. Though the transport department and police have launched measures to curb footboard travel from time to time , they never bring in desire results except for the first few days. Footboard travel is a menace found not just in cities , but also in villages, thanks to the mushrooming of educational institutions and industrial houses in the suburbs . Educational institutions, be it universities or colleges or schools, operate a large number of buses for the benefit of student community. One cannot notice footboard travel in these buses, as they enrol only a limited number of students every trip. Many students opt out of these buses, as the fee charged is on the higher side and these buses take a circuitous route covering many interior areas, due to which the students have to leave their homes much in advance. Moreover, the students prefer city buses as they can return back homes as per their liking, without waiting for the college buses. During the peak hour rush office-goers and students could be seen waiting at Central and Chathiram bus stand and in all the city bus stops. The introduction of vestibule buses, however, has reduced the congestion to a certain extent. A cross section of the people demand more vestibule buses mainly in the routes where educational institutions are situated. Moreover, student-specials should be introduced from places such as Woraiyur, Tennur, Subramaniapuram, Palpannai, and Palakkarai in the morning hours and from areas such as Melapudur and Puthur, where a cluster of institutions are situated. Following the Chennai tragedy, officials have launched a crackdown against footboard travelling in the city buses. During a drive conducted in the peak hours in the morning on Friday, a team of officials, led by Balasubramanian, Regional Transport Officer, Tiruchi, checked as many as 84 city buses. Cases were booked against seven private buses and one STC bus, after the officials found commuters travelling in footboard in these vehicles. D.R.Dharmaraj, secretary, Tiruchi Private Bus Operators' Association, says that the commuters cooperation is must for preventing the recurrence of such tragedies. Many youth have the tendency of travelling by standing near the footboard. Any amount of appeal by the bus crew never bothers them. On many occasion, they even pick up quarrel with the crew, leading to unpleasant incidents, he says, adding that the situation is the same in the rural routes too. The authorities with the cooperation of the authorities of the educational institutions and parents should come forward to sensitize youth to the younger generation. The fleet operators will extend total cooperation in this regard, he adds. Ameer Ahmed Munavary, a retired railway official, concurred with Mr.Dharmaraj and said that sensitisation programmes are the need of the hour. Strict enforcement of traffic and safety rules and forming a committee including students representatives to give counselling on the dangers of footboard travelling will go a long way in curbing this menace, Mr.Munavary says. The operation of additional DEMU trains during the peak hours from centres such as Ariyalur, Thanjavur, Pudukottai to Tiruchi will reduce the congestion in buses. With the closure of the Ariyamangalam railway station, hundreds of students and workers have to travel only by city buses. This station should be reopened, says A.Selvaraj, an office bearer of the Vijay Fans Association, Sangiliandapuram.  OPEN",

Sylendra Babu announced a New Year gift for the city's traders, especially hotels, wayside eateries and tea shops: these can remain open till midnight. These establishments will now have an extra hour of business from New Year's Day. This is the first relaxation of timings since the November 1997 communal riots and the February 14, 1998 serial blasts. Till these two incidents, there had been no restriction on business hours. Talking to T he Hindu, Mr. Sylendra Babu said that the decision to ensure closure of shops at 11 p.m. was taken during the communal unrest situation in a bid to maintain law and order. The 11 p.m. deadline was fixed to restrict movement of people so that law breakers could be isolated. The decision of the police to permit shopkeepers to remain open till 12 p.m. comes as a big relief not only for the eateries and hoteliers but also for the people. The Commissioner said that the city now accounted for a large number of industries, having a workforce working in shifts, besides accounting for a large number of colleges, hospitals, business visitors to Coimbatore and persons employed in software companies. Any one reaching Coimbatore at late hours by bus or train often found it difficult to get affordable and hygienic food or for that matter even a cup of hot tea or coffee. Executive Director of Anaphora Group of Hotels D.S. Jagan said that the request for extension of business hours to hoteliers was pending for the last several years. Welcoming the decision, Mr.Jagan said that the public at large and hotel association members in busy areas, closer to bus stands and railway stations would benefit by this decision.   OPEN",

At a press conference here on Friday, BJP spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain said that 35 years after the Emergency, the Congress party had ultimately admitted officially that the Emergency was a black chapter in the modern history of the country. He said that accepting violations of democratic and human rights during Emergency was to be appreciated. So far as the question of responsibility for the Emergency is concerned, the BJP is of the opinion that each and every Congress leader of that time is responsible for it, he said. He was referring to Congress and the Making of the Indian Nation a book edited by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee on the completion of the Congress's 125 years. He said the BJP was firm on its demand for constituting a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to probe the 2G spectrum scam. He said the United Progressive Alliance government's refusal to constitute a JPC showed the height of its obstinacy. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh knew very well the difference between a probe by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and that of JPC. If the Prime Minister was not involved and had nothing to hide, as claimed by him, then it became his moral duty to order constitution of a JPC to ensure proper probe into the scam. In fact, the entire Opposition had been demanding a probe by the JPC. While stubbornly refusing the demand, the Congress was on a slander campaign to mislead the common man.   OPEN",

Mr. Vishnunath also clarified that according to a recent amendment to the constitution of the Youth Congress, action against an elected member of the organisation could be taken only by the national committee. This had prompted the State committee to ask the leadership to conduct an inquiry, he said. To a query whether the Youth Congress took serious view of the allegations against National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) chairman K.G.

Things took an ugly turn for Rao, a security guard in Baba Nivas apartment, when he got trapped in the lift and choked to death as power was switched off as a precautionary measure. Minutes after flames erupted from the shed abutting the apartment, Rao raised an alarm asking flat-owners to come down through the staircase. He went to the fifth-floor twice and rescued at least 10 persons. He went back to fifth-floor after an occupant, Murthy, called him to switch off LPG cylinder in his house. While trying to come down, he entered the lift and soon after it was crossing the third floor, other flat-owners switched off the power supply without realising that the guard was using the lift. Chaos It was chaos all over. Some were rushing down the staircase while others scrambled to the terrace to jump onto the adjacent GNRs R.K. Residency using ladders. But none heard his pleas. Rao tried to break the iron grills of the lift but in vain. Blood stain marks on the grills indicated that he repeatedly banged his head to open the lift. Filmnagar fire officer D. Mohan Rao said the victim could have died due to asphyxiation after thick smoke engulfed the five-storeyed Baba Nivas apartment. We broke open the lift grills and retrieved Raos body around 2 a.m. on Monday, he said. Hailing from Ramachandrapuram in East Godavari district, Rao and his family came to city four years ago. He was working as a security guard at the apartment for the past two years. Apart from attending to security duties, he used to attend other works assigned by the flat-owners. His death is a big loss to the family, as he was the only breadwinner, said Sheshamma, an occupant in the apartment. Rajendranagar MLA T. Prakash Goud visited the spot and consoled the bereaved family members.  OPEN",

The intelligence agencies had alerted the security forces that four militants had entered the Kashmir Valley, Mr. Singh said. We were alert. Two terrorists have been killed There might be two more who are out, he said. A fresh alert has been sounded in Jammu and Kashmir. Meanwhile, Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said the government was looking into the possibility of Pakistan-based elements being behind the attack. We are still inquiringWe are analysing how the attack took place, he told journalists. The killing of CRPF jawans was a sad incident, Mr. Shinde said. It was difficult to predict when terror would strike. The incident had served to remind the security agencies and the government that they had to remain very alert in Kashmir. On the Jammu and Kashmir governments demand for removal of the controversial Armed Forces (Special) Powers Act (AFSPA), Mr. Shinde said: We are working on it... We are thinking...We will see.

District Judge I. S.

        "content": " Key Taliban leader Agha Jan Motasim has been removed from a United Nations list targeting the insurgent organisation in a move, a western diplomatic source has told The Hindu , aimed at kick-starting its stalled dialogue process with the United States and the Afghan governments. Formerly Finance Minister and chief administrator in the Islamist regime deposed after 9/11, and a son-in-law of Taliban chief Mullah Muhammad Omar, Agha Jan Motasim has been undergoing treatment in Ankara, ever since an August 2010 assassination attempt in Karachi. Turkish authorities had earlier said they would ask Mr. Motasim to leave the country when his treatment was completed, and it remains unclear if he will continue to function from that country. Mr. Motasim was among three Taliban envoys, who attended a 2011 meeting with the United States in Bonn and Doha. The Taliban had later announced they would open a political office in Doha, but called off talks after the United States rejected its demands for the release of prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay. Limited waiver The United Nations had earlier provided a limited waiver to Mr. Motasim, allowing him to travel to Turkey. His removal from the United Nations 1988 list, which draws its name from the Security Council resolution that created it in 2011, will allow him to travel freely and engage in political activities. It isnt clear how much influence Mr. Motasim has with Taliban on the ground, the diplomat said, but we hope this will open up at least some space for a serious conversation on what is possible. Mr. Motasim is believed to been among the seminary students who founded the Taliban in 1994, and is reported to have been injured thrice in battle. He disappeared into Pakistan, along with Mullah Omar in 2001. In 2003, though, he gave an online interview, saying he had been given charge of the Talibans new political affairs commission. Ex-head of Quetta shura In 2009, Mr. Motasim took charge of the Talibans key decision-making body, the Quetta shura. He laid down several preconditions for talks in an interview to al-Jazeera, calling for complete western troop withdrawal, the release of all Taliban prisoners and the end of United Nations sanctions. Reports of negotiations between the Taliban and the West, Mr. Motasim said, were a pure fabrication and a lie and baseless. Later that year, though, Mr. Motasim was reported to have been tried and found guilty by a Taliban council on allegations of maintaining unauthorised contact with European diplomats. The allegations, Kabul-based intelligence sources have told The Hindu , came about because of Mr. Motasims secret talks that began in 2007. His key rival, Abdul Ghani Baradar, then took control of the shura. It remains unclear whether the contacts were sanctioned by elements the Taliban hierarchy. Both Mr. Motasim and Mr. Baradar were arrested by Pakistan in 2010, as part of a series of raids alleged to have been conducted to stop the Taliban from striking an independent deal with the United States. The men were released last year, following intense pressure from the United States In an interview given to The Daily Beast earlier this year, Mr. Motasim suggested that the subsequent attempt on his life was carried out by some of my colleagues and friends [who] did not agree with my concept that the Taliban should be a political movement. Two types of Taliban In a separate interview to The Associated Press, Mr. Motasim said there were now two kinds of Taliban. The one type of Taliban who believes that the foreigners want to solve the problem but there is another group and they dont believe, and they are thinking that the foreigners only want to fight. I can tell you, though, that the majority of the Taliban and the Taliban leadership want a broad-based government for all Afghan people and an Islamic system. Later this month, the United Nations sanctions committee is expected to release the findings of a full internal review of the sanctions list. The review could open the way for delisting more Taliban figures such as Mr. Baradar, who are thought to be engaged in peace talks but remain on the sanctions list.  OPEN",

It has been two days since C.H. Mohiuddin (43) was beaten up by a group of 30 men, allegedly from the local unit of the Bajrang Dal in Mudigere, Chikmagalur taluk. Doctors at Father Muller Medical College Hospital said it would take at least a couple of days for him to recover. As he is the breadwinner of the family, Mr. Mohiuddins wife Ayesha Bi is concerned over the mounting hospital bill. According to Ayesha Bi it all started on November 22 evening when Mr. Mohiuddin parked his autorickshaw in front of a shop run by Sudeva, the taluk president of the local Bajrang Dal unit. Many other vehicles were also parked there. Yet, for some reason, they picked a fight with him. They said the space was meant for parking their cars, and started arguing with him. But they left it like that, and my husband returned home, she said. The next day, however, the group called him up to reach a compromise, and on Saturday he was summoned to the same shop, she said. When he went there around 7.30 p.m. with his elder brother C.H. Ahmed Bava, a group of 30 men surrounded them and assaulted the brothers. They abused themFor at least about half an hour, they assaulted my husband, Ms. Ayesha told The Hindu . While Mr. Bava suffered minor injuries, Mr. Mohiuddin was admitted to a private clinic in the town before being transferred to a hospital in Chikmagalur. The doctors refused to treat him there. It was only after Ms. Ayesha Bi started weeping that they sent him to Mangalore in an ambulance on Sunday evening, said a relative. The change in hospitals and the treatment has so far racked up bills of around Rs. 7,000, said the family, and this could go up to more than Rs. 10,000 in the next few days, something they said they could not afford. Its a hand to mouth existence. My son is studying in Class 10, and my daughter was married off only recently. I do not know how we are going to clear the bills, Ms. Ayesha Bi said. Autorickshaw drivers observed a bandh at Mudigere on Monday, protesting against the incident and auto drivers in Chikmagalur have called for a bandh on Tuesday. The incident has shocked us all, and yet, Sudeva has been issuing threats to us to drop the cases against him, Mr. Bava said over phone from Mudigere. Shashikumar N., Superintendent of Police, Chikmagalur, said an attempt to murder case had been filed against the people, who have been stated as members of Bajrang Dal, mentioned in the FIR. No arrests had been made so far.  OPEN",

Gopinath, Inspector General of Police (Thrissur Range), said at the seminar here on Saturday that stringent measures would be taken in cases of violence against women and children. The home, which should be a shelter, is becoming a trap or a place of torture for women. And the men with whom the women share their lives become the perpetrators of the most horrendous violence against them, he said. The problem had to be addressed with a combination of legal strategies, with public education and support services, he said. Domestic violence was not just about a man assaulting a woman. Nor was it about the domination of one over the other. It was a problem for which the solution existed at home but few ever thought of it, the seminar observed. According to Domestic Violence Act, not only physical abuse but also threats of violence, sexual abuse, verbal or emotional abuse such as insults, ridicule, calling names and humiliation about not having a child or a male child can be termed as violence. Even deprivation from economic or financial resources to which the victim is entitled too comes under the definition of domestic violence, the seminar noted.

Raju met the woman, also a labourer, at Tolichowki a few weeks ago. Raju would now and then give small amounts of money to the woman and she would return it. A few days ago, they quarrelled over payment of the money. He bore a grudge against the woman and hatched a plot with his friend, Laxmikanth, to eliminate her. He lured Somli to his friends room stating that he had some work. The duo consumed liquor there and sexually assaulted her before smashing her head with a brick. They took away the jewellery she wore, Inspector S. Jayaram said. History-sheeters murder case The murder of Marredpally history-sheeter M. Shekhar was masterminded by C.

        "content": " Several vehicles were torched and industrial units vandalised by protesters who turned violent and clashed with factory owners in Noida on Wednesday during the first day of the two-day nationwide strike by central trade unions. The police have arrested 60 people on charges of rioting, arson, robbery and causing damage to public property. In contrast, Gurgaon remained by and large peaceful. While some trade union leaders alleged that two persons were killed in the police lathicharge that triggered the violence in Noida, the police issued a denial. All-India Trade Union Congress general secretary and Lok Sabha member Gurudas Dasgupta said no death was reported during the protests in Noida. The police have registered 60 cases and are examining CCTV footage of factories to identify those involved. Extra force has been summoned to prevent further violence in the industrial pockets. Earlier on Wednesday, hundreds of workers participating in the strike gathered in the industrial area of Sector 82-83 in Noida Phase 2 and called on those working in the factories located at Hosiery Complex to join the protest. When confronted by the factory owners and their men, a large group of workers turned violent and set ablaze vehicles parked in the area. They vandalised the factories, smashed glass panes and allegedly took away from there whatever they could lay their hands on. The mob targeted two fire tenders that reached the spot to douse the blaze. While protests were also reported in Sectors 56, 59, 60, 68 and 81 of Noida, the workers clashed with the police at Labour Chowk in Sector 57. Condemning the violence, the Noida Entrepreneurs Association alleged that over 1,000 factory units were targeted, 35 vehicles torched and 110 vehicles damaged. They accused the police of inaction, stating that the association had intimated the force in advance, expressing apprehension that the protesters might indulge in violence. The association, which in its meeting on Wednesday took a unanimous decision to keep the factories operational on the second day of the protest, demanded compensation and stringent action against the labour unions involved and also against the administrative and police officers who failed to react in time. The association, through a letter on Tuesday, demanded adequate security from the police for the industrial units in view of the strike call. While no violence was reported in neighbouring Gurgaon, production in the Gurgaon-Manesar automobile sector is expected to come to a halt on Thursday as workers unions of major automobile industries have decided to stay away from work. All the major unions, including those of Maruti Suzuki, Honda, Hero Motocorp, Sona Koyo Steering Systems and Munjal Auto have decided to take part in the strike on Thursday. It would have a huge impact on production in the automobile sector in the region as the ancillary units would also be forced to shut down their business for a day. Except in a few garments factories, industrial activity is expected to be come to a standstill on Thursday, said All-India Trade Unions Gurgaon general-secretary Anil Pawar. The two-day Bharat Bandh call evoked a mixed response in Gurgaon on the first day  banking services and public transport were badly hit, but most of the commercial establishments, shopping malls and major automobile industries functioned as usual. No major incident of violence was reported. There was a minor clash between Haryana Roadways employees and the police near the bus stand. Banking services were affected the most as all the public sector banks across the city remained closed, though privates banks worked as usual. A senior ICICI bank official posted in the Sector 15 branch said the private banks witnessed a huge rush of customers, who visited the bank mostly for business transactions. Most of the Haryana Roadways buses also remained off the road, though autorickshaws plied as usual. Electricity board and post-office employees also supported the strike. A large number of activists of the All-India Trade Union Congress, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions and the Karamchari Mahasangh staged a sit-in near the local bus stand throughout the day raising slogans against the anti-labour policies of the government.

These organisations are the root cause of hatred and enmity between people in the nation, a press release stated.

In light of Swami Aseemanand's confession of his involvement in the Malegaon 2006 blast, they demanded bail for the nine accused arrested in the case. If there is a blast in a masjid and Muslims are killed, even a common man will tell you that it cannot be the job of a Muslim person. Investigating agencies have deliberately twisted investigations and trapped Muslim youths. Strict inquiry and action is needed against the RSS and erring investigators. A blast is a blot on the nation, Malegaon's Maulana Azhari, who was at the rally, told The Hindu. The other demands of the protesters were unconditional release of Muslim youths who are still behind bars in connection with the Mecca Masjid, Ajmer Sharif, and Samjhauta Express blasts, and impartial investigation into the murder of Sunil Joshi, RSS pracharak who was suspected to be working under Swami Aseemanand.

        "content": " Unhappy with the slow pace of the 26/11 case trial in Pakistan, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday asked the visiting Interior Minister, Rehman Malik, to ensure that all those behind the attacks were brought to justice at the earliest. Mr. Malik, who called on Dr. Singh at his official residence, invited him to visit Pakistan. He told him that soon a Pakistani judicial commission would come to India, a process that would fast-track the trial. His [Dr. Singhs) point of view was that my people here ask what you have done for the people who suffered during 26/11. We have given him a commitment to send a judicial commission here...It was a very good meeting, Mr. Malik told journalists after the meeting. It is learnt that Pakistan has agreed to let a team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which probes the case, visit the country early next year. Mr. Malik, who met National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon and Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Friday, said: Whatever trust deficit was there, it was removed. Let the Director-General of the FIA (Pakistans Federal Investigation Agency) and the NIA sit together and resolve issues, he noted. The NIA wants to visit Pakistan to examine the evidence collected by their agencies against the accused, including the mastermind of the attacks and Jamaat-ud-Dawa founder Hafiz Saeed. Similarly, a Pakistani judicial commission is likely to visit India later this month to cross-examine the witnesses, so that their statements could be presented as proof against the accused. However, Mr. Malik said Hafiz Saeed could not be arrested till India gave hard and substantive evidence. The Pakistani government was trying to fast-track his case, as an application had been filed in the Lahore High Court. Referring to Indias demand for the voice samples of terrorists who directed the attackers from a control room in Pakistan, Mr. Malik said that as per Pakistans law, the voice sample could not be given unless permission was given by the accused himself. We have moved the High Court in the matter of [Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Zaki-ur Rehman] Lakhvis voice sample, and it is pending there.   OPEN",

        "content": " : The Special Additional District Sessions Court (Marad cases) at Eranhipalam, here, on Saturday granted permission to the Crime Branch  Crime Investigation Department (CB-CID) to interrogate T.K. Rajeesh in connection with the killing of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha State vice-president K.T. Jayakrishnan in Kannur 13 years ago. Special judge R. Narayana Pisharadi issued orders for questioning Rajeesh, fourth accused in the murder of Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) leader T.P. Chandrasekharan, after the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Crime Branch (Hurt and Homicide Wing), A.P. Shoukath Ali, moved a petition in this regard. From December 17 The accused, who is now in judicial custody at the Kannur Central Prison could be interrogated from December 17 to 21. The Special Court ( Marad Cases) is carrying out the trial in the Chandrasekharan murder case. So permission was necessary to question him in connection with another case. The interrogation should be taken place in the presence of the Jail Superintendent, the court said. The Home Department decided to reopen the Jayakrishnan murder case after it obtained a legal opinion in the wake of disclosures by Rajeesh that only one person, Acharampathu Pradeepan, former secretary, local committee, Mokeri, of the Communist Party of India-(Marxist) [CPI-M] was involved in the case and that all others charge-sheeted were dummies furnished by the party leadership. Rajeesh, allegedly a member of the killer gang hired by a section of leaders of the (CPI-M) in Kozhikode and Kannur districts to eliminate Chandrasekharan, had reportedly confessed to the investigators that he was part of the gang that arrived in two jeeps to kill Jayakrishnan in a classroom at East Mokeri U.P. School, Kannur, on December 1, 1999. The government issued orders handing over the case to a Crime branch team led by Shoukath Ali this month. Subsequently the Crime Branch sought permission to conduct further investigation in the case under Section 173(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure from the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court at Thalassery.

        "content": " The Tea Board of India is focusing on small tea growers and supporting them through various schemes, its chairman M.G.V.K. Bhanu said here on Saturday. On the sidelines of the Plantation Crops Symposium, hosted by the Tea Research Institute under the United Planters Association of South India (UPASI), he told The Hindu that the Board had proposed that in the XII Plan allocation, 25 per cent would be earmarked for small tea growers. Explaining the initiatives of the Board, Mr. Bhanu said that India mostly exported tea in bulk. In an effort to give a thrust to value addition, his organisation promoted export of tea in small quantities, providing assistance to anyone exporting tea in small quantities (less than one kg bags). Further, anyone planting tea now had to take permission from the Board and register with it. We want more people to plant tea, he said. In the proposed amendment to the Tea Act, the Board was for giving exemption to those who had plots and tea bushes on it from seeking prior permission for tea planting. Still, such persons could still register themselves with the Board. Addressing the conference, he said that the Board was supporting mechanisation, promoting value addition in tea, and supporting marketing efforts. It had linked all subsidies to quality and even in research activities, it had linked release of funds to performance of tea research projects. At the valedictory of the conference, former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam said though India was the largest tea exporter till a couple of decades ago and was the largest producer of tea globally till 2005, the present production in the country (966 million kg) was 30 per cent less than China. There was a huge potential for better price realisation based on quality and value addition. With changing market dynamics and agro processing technologies, there was a need to redefine tea industry. Mr. Kalam stressed the need for empowering small farmers, training farmers in tea, providing loans at low interest to them, cooperative and micro financing facilities, encouraging value addition in tea and aiming for integrated development of product, process, and social development. Climate change James Jacob, president of Indian Society of Plantation Crops, said the plantation sector faced several challenges such as declining soil health, climate change, and need for eco-friendly farm practices. G.J. Ancheril, president of UPASI, said that the sector would have to adopt mechanisation for survival. It was found that 60 per cent of field operations in tea sector could be fully or semi-mechanised. A major portion of the production cost in tea went towards wages.  OPEN",

Nature is not in our hands. Climate change is already affecting rainfall. Under such a situation, directing a State to release a certain quantity of water in a particular month will only lead to conflicts between the riparian States, he said. The former Minister said that such directions with regard to the Cauvery had already made the issue complicated.

He said the Bharatiya Janata Party Government had completely neglected the core sectors of power, irrigation and agriculture in the State.

Shoukat Ali Alur, district general secretary of the CPI, told presspersons on Friday that the party would stage a protest in front of the Deputy Commissioner's office here on January 17 demanding compensation for the affected farmers in various taluks. Worst-affected Farmers in Jewargi, Aland, Afzalpur and Chitapur taluks are the worst hit by the spurious toor and black gram seeds. The crops had good vegetative growth but bore no seeds. The State Government should pay a compensation of Rs. 10,000 an acre to each farmer. Private companies had supplied spurious seeds under different brand names such as Ankur, Asha, Maruti and PMR, he said. He suspected that some officials of the Karnataka State Seeds Corporation and the Agriculture Department had connived with the private companies in supplying spurious seeds to farmers. He urged the Government to book criminal cases against the guilty, including officials, and blacklist the suppliers. He sought a Lokayukta inquiry into the incident. Stating that toor growers had also been hit by a steep fall in price, Mr. Alur urged the Government to release Rs. 100 crore to the Toor Development Board to procure toor dal and check the fall in price. He criticised the Central team for arriving late to assess the rain damage in the State. The district administration too had failed to provide proper information to the team about the loss suffered by farmers. District in-charge Minister Basavaraj Bommai was not present when the team visited Gulbarga. All these factors ensured that the team's visit served no purpose, he said. Government Order Meanwhile, the State Government has in its order announced that FAQ quality toor dal would be bought by the Karnataka State Cooperative Marketing Federation at Rs. 3,000 a quintal. In addition, Rs. 500 a quintal bonus would be paid to growers during January and February. The federation will set up procurement centres in Gulbarga, Bidar, Raichur, Koppal, Yadgir and Bijapur districts for the purpose,, said a release.

A red sander log was found in the vicinity that suggests his involvement in the spree of smuggling incidents during the last week. Though initially believed to be an encounter death, both the forest and police departments claimed no role behind it, besides indicating that it could be a result of internal squabbles among two groups of smugglers. Superintendent of Police (Tirupati Urban) J. Prabhakar Rao preferred to wait for the post-mortem report before coming to a conclusion on the nature of the death.

Inaugurating a womens conference organised in connection with the 38th State conference of the Joint Council of State Service Organisations, Ms. Raja said the horrible truth on sex ratio was exposed after each census. The latest census showed that in the population aged between 0 and 6 years, there was a big fall in the number of girls in the country and the situation in Kerala was no different. The NFIW leader said the country faced a moral and ethical crisis and the most ignored were women. She noted that were even attempts by some quarters to dilute the existing laws that provided security to women. She said the proposal for Foreign Direct Investment would destroy the livelihood of about 5 crore women in India. Ms. Raja said infant mortality rate continued to be high in India as large sections of women were unhealthy for want of proper nutrition. Ms. Raja alleged that the Food Security Bill was an attempt to destroy the public distribution system.  OPEN",

        "content": " : The Special Additional District Sessions Court (Marad cases) at Eranhipalam, here, on Saturday granted permission to the Crime Branch  Crime Investigation Department (CB-CID) to interrogate T.K. Rajeesh in connection with the killing of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha State vice-president K.T. Jayakrishnan in Kannur 13 years ago. Special judge R. Narayana Pisharadi issued orders for questioning Rajeesh, fourth accused in the murder of Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) leader T.P. Chandrasekharan, after the Deputy Superintendent of Police (Dy. SP), Crime Branch (Hurt and Homicide Wing), A.P. Shoukath Ali, moved a petition in this regard. The accused, who is now in judicial custody at the Kannur Central Prison could be interrogated from December 17 to 21. The Special Court ( Marad Cases) is carrying out the trial in the Chandrasekharan murder case. So permission was necessary to question him in connection with another case. The interrogation should be taken place in the presence of the Jail Superintendent, the court said. The Home Department decided to reopen the Jayakrishnan murder case after it obtained a legal opinion in the wake of disclosures by Rajeesh that only one person, Acharampathu Pradeepan, former secretary, local committee, Mokeri, of the Communist Party of India-(Marxist) [CPI-M] was involved in the case and that all others charge-sheeted were dummies furnished by the party leadership. Rajeesh, allegedly a member of the killer gang hired by a section of leaders of the (CPI-M) in Kozhikode and Kannur districts to eliminate Chandrasekharan, had reportedly confessed to the investigators that he was part of the gang that arrived in two jeeps to kill Jayakrishnan in a classroom at East Mokeri U.P. School, Kannur, on December 1, 1999. The government issued orders handing over the case to a Crime branch team led by Shoukath Ali this month. Subsequently the Crime Branch sought permission to conduct further investigation in the case under Section 173(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure from the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court at Thalassery. The court said no permission was required as the sanction for re-investigation had already been granted by the government after receiving legal opinion.

Vijaya Kumar from Madiwala has over 15 criminal cases, including murder, pending against him. He surrendered before court when the CCB officials launched a search for him after the murder of Vinay Alva in J.P. Nagar in 2009 over a financial dispute. Vijaya Kumar, the police said, ran his gang from jail. This, the police added, hampered the operations of Ravi Poojary prompting the latter to eliminate his rival. Ravi Poojary contracted the murder to the henchmen of Kutty Raja after Vijaya Kumar was released on bail, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Fraser Town Sub-division) Shivamurthy told The Hindu . The conspiracy came to light on Saturday night when Shivaji Nagar police arrested Anand Kumar (32) and Madhusoodhan (23), both henchmen of Kutty Raja, during a routine check. The police recovered a country-made revolver with several rounds of ammunition from them. Anand Kumar was involved in the shoot-out at Shabnam Developers on the behest of Ravi Poojary in February 2007. Though he was arrested and was in jail, he came out on bail recently. An arrest warrant had been issued against him as he had jumped bail. The police were on the lookout for him when he was caught on Saturday.  OPEN",

The party MLAs T. Nageswara Rao and S. Venkata Veeraiah, besides a host of others, including the party district president Kondabala Koteswara Rao, participated in a demonstration held at the main entrance of the hub of district administration. Addressing the protesters, Mr. Venkata Veeraiah alleged that the government remained insensitive to the plight of the cyclone-affected farmers in the district. Notwithstanding the announcement made by Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy that Khammam was the second worst-hit district after East Godavari in terms of devastation caused by the cyclone Nilam in November, the farmers, hard hit by the cyclonic storm in the district, were yet to receive any concrete relief from the government, he said. Mr. Kiran Kumar Reddy personally assessed the magnitude of the cyclone devastation at Ganeshpadu in Dammapeta mandal during his district visit in November first week, he said, lamenting that the assurances given by the Chief Minister to the farmers did not materialise till date. Clear proof The extent of crop damage suffered by farmers in the district was underestimated during the enumeration process, he charged, and demanded that the government ensure adequate compensation to all the cyclone-hit farmers without further delay. He alleged that the government was trying to shirk from its bounden duty of lending a helping hand to the distressed maize growers. Referring to the setting ablaze of cotton produce by an aggrieved farmer at the cotton market yard in Khammam on Saturday, Mr. Veeraiah said the incident was clear proof of the mental agony being experienced by the distressed farmers due to the governments apathy. The government should streamline the functioning of the CCI and other agencies concerned to ensure purchase of the entire agriculture produce of the farmers, including the discoloured paddy at minimum support price, he said.

Petitioner Amarsinh Chaudhari said that though smoking was banned in many public places and restrictions were imposed on the sale of tobacco products, the public transport services continued displaying advertisements of tobacco products. This should be immediately banned since these products were detrimental to public health. Accepting the plea, the bench issued the order stating that gutkha, cigarettes and other injurious items like paan masala, if made from the prohibited items, shall not be displayed either by the AMTS or GSRTC. The GSRTC and the AMTS informed the court that the government transport services would not invite any tender for advertisement of tobacco products or accept any such ads.

If not the CPI (M) would conduct a series of agitations in the district with the co-operation of like-minded parties including All India Anna Dravida Munnetta Kazagham, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetta Kazagham and Community Party of India. When the Government least bothered about deforestation and illegal quarrying in different parts of the district, they implemented the Private Forest Conservation Act by giving hardship to small and marginal farmers. Moreover as told by M.S.Swaminathan, chairman of National Commission for Farmers, 45 percent of farmers wanted to quit farming in the country owing to price raise in agriculture inputs, Mr.Ramakrishnan urged the Government to ensure the welfare of farmers by withdrawing the implementation of such act. The CPI (M) wanted to ensure the rights and welfare of farming community, he said.   OPEN",

Tyagi, and his three cousins, besides nine others and six companies, have been named by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the case it registered in the VVIP chopper scam. The agency suspects the retired Air Chief Marshal had approved certain changes in the tender specifications that opened the doors for the Italian firm AgustaWestland to bid for the contract. A fortnight after the agency instituted a Preliminary Enquiry into the matter, it registered a case of alleged corruption, conspiracy and cheating against the 13 accused persons, six companies and their unknown accomplices under various provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code. The CBI has alleged that AgustaWestland paid bribes through middlemen to influence public servants in order to swing the deal  for supply of 12 VVIP helicopters  in its favour. The CBI has alleged that during his tenure, the former IAF chief approved the reduction of the service ceiling of VVIP helicopters from 6,000 metres to 4,500 metres, a move that was previously opposed consistently by the IAF citing security related issues. AgustaWestland, which could not have qualified for the tender, was allowed to bid because of the relaxation made in the specifications, said a source in the agency. The agency on Wednesday conducted searches in Delhi, Gurgaon, Chandigarh and Mohali at the residences of Mr. Tyagi and the other accused persons and companies. Among those named in the case are the retired IAF chiefs cousins Julie, Docsa and Sandeep Tyagi; Chief Executive Officer of Aeromatrix Info Solution Private Limited Praveen Bakshi; IDS Infotech Chairman Satish Bagrodia and its Managing Director Pratap K. Aggarwal; and advocate Gautam Khaitan. Giuseppe Orsi, the then CEO of AgustaWestlands parent company Finmeccanica; and Bruno Spagnolini, the then CEO of United Kingdom-based AgustaWestland, have also been named along with alleged middlemen Guido Ralph Haschke, Carlo Valentino Ferdinando Gerosa and Christian Michel. The companies named in the case are Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland, IDS (Tunisia), Infotech Design System (Mauritius), IDS Infotech (Mohali) and Aeromatrix (Chandigarh). It is alleged that in the procurement process of the helicopters, some persons acted as middlemen and allegedly influenced the deal in favour of the U. K-based company. It is also alleged that the Italy-based company paid commissions running into several million Euros to the middlemen who from their share allegedly paid huge sums of money to some Indian nationals under the garb of engineering contracts with the two India-based companies, said a CBI official. According to the sources in the CBI, investigations so far have revealed that Mr. Michel was allegedly paid 30 million Euros by the supplier company for the job and a part of that money is suspected to have made its way to India. The agency has also come across evidence to suggest that 24 million Euros were allegedly paid separately to Mr. Haschke and Mr. Gerosa.  OPEN",

Stalin on Saturday exhorted his party functionaries to be prepared to make sacrifices and work hard to ensure a thumping victory for the DMK in the forthcoming Parliamentary elections. A landslide win in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections was crucial as it would serve as the base for the next Assembly polls, Mr. Stalin said addressing a meeting of DMK functionaries of Tiruchi Parliamentary constituency encompassing Tiruchi and Pudukottai districts here. Stating that the party was not demoralised for being out of power in the State, Mr. Stalin called upon the cadre to bear in mind that the Parliamentary elections were on the anvil and strengthen DMK leader M. Karunanidhis hands by working hard at the grassroots level. The last one-and-years had provided him an opportunity to tour the State and interact with party functionaries besides enabling him to concentrate completely for party works, Mr. Stalin said. The DMK, he said, would not be cowed down by intimidatory measures in the form of cases being booked against party functionaries over the last one-and-half years. Taking a pot shot at the AIADMK government, he said its biggest achievement in the last one-and-half years was that many Ministers had been dropped from the Cabinet and frequent transfers of IAS and IPS officials. If elections were to be announced now, the DMK would win, Mr.Stalin claimed. The power cuts the State witnessed during the DMK regime from 2006 to 2011 was because no power schemes were devised during the AIADMK regime from 2001 to 2006, Mr. Stalin alleged. DMK Tiruchi district secretary and former Minister K.N. Nehru, Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi N. Siva and party functionaries from Tiruchi and Pudukottai districts spoke on the occasion.  OPEN",

The officiating Inspector General of Police, Kashmir, Abdul Gani Mir said that two unidentified militants were gunned down after they attacked and killed the CRPF men on the playground of J&K Police Public School at Bemina around 10.45 a.m. He said six more paramilitary personnel and four civilians sustained injuries in the suicide attack, unprecedented in the States history of militancy in 23 years. Mr. Mir, who is currently IGP Crime in J&K and had arrived in Srinagar minutes before the shootout, said that the Police school had been already closed for Wednesday due to the separatists-sponsored call for shutdown. Had the school been open, the toll would have been higher, he told The Hindu . He was not sure about the number of the militants who carried out the attack at the F company headquarters of CRPF 73 battalion but said that none other than the two militants was found dead or alive during the following cordon-and-search operation in the locality. Both the militants at the playground were killed and we have seized two of their AK-56 rifles besides some hand grenades along with their bodies. The area is now cleared for traffic, Mr. Mir said. According to him, two young men wearing sports outfits and each carrying a sports bag had appeared at the playground and engaged the CRPF men in a friendly cricket match. A number of youth from the nearby localities were watching and playing the game when the two strangers suddenly took out their automatic rifles and attacked the unarmed paramilitary personnel. They lobbed grenades and sprayed bullets, killing five CRPF men. Even after others at the camp took positions and the young players ran for life, both the militants kept on firing in all directions. They were soon gunned down, Mr. Mir said. He said that the militants were unidentified but the police had seized certain documents and other evidence from their belongings that could lead to their identification. In New Delhi, Home Secretary R.K. Singh said: Prima facie, the terrorists appear to be from across the border and were Pakistani nationals. A caller who said his name was Baleeg-ud-din and claimed to be a Hizbul Mujahideen spokesman told a local news gathering agency that two militants of his organisation had carried out the attack. He reportedly warned that such attacks would continue in the future. Senior officials, however, insisted that this could be an attempt to mislead the police and security forces as Hizbul Mujahideen in the past had publicly disapproved suicide attacks as un-Islamic. They said that only a few Pakistan-based jihadist outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad had carried out such strikes in J&K for over a decade of the prime of militancy before 2010. LeT, they said, was the first suspect. A suicide-type attack had left two employees of a hotel on the highway bypass dead in October 2012.  OPEN",

        "content": " The Madras High Court has recently resolved a 45-year-old dispute between a contractor and Southern Railway over calculation of charges for the civil works carried out by him before the construction of a diesel locomotive shed at Erode in 1965. Justice M. Venugopal resolved the dispute while disposing of an Appeal Suit filed by the Union of India, represented by the General Manager, Southern Railway, against a judgement passed by a lower court in 2001 in favour of the contractor in a civil suit filed by him in 1969. The appellant claimed that the lower court had come to an erroneous conclusion that the contractor had cleared 9,81,000 cubic feet of rubble and ordered a payment of Rs.2,78,604 though as per records he had cleared only 6,17,816 cubic feet and entitled to Rs.46,153. Not part of written agreement On the other hand, the contractor stated that the works related to clearing the rubble was not part of the written agreement to build the loco shed. Yet, he agreed to do the job only after the then Executive Engineer Railways agreed to pay him Rs.284 per 1,000 cubic feet. But he never expected a volte face. After completion of the work, the higher officials said that they would make the payment only at the rate of around Rs.29 per cubic metre as per the Basic Schedule of Rates (BSR), 1961. The contractor received the money under protest and filed the suit claiming the balance due to him. Finding force in his submission, Mr. Justice Venugopal said that the Southern Railway, which had benefited out of the civil work done by the contractor, was bound to pay the latter at the rate of Rs.284 per 1,000 cubic feet especially when the quantum had been agreed upon by the then Executive Engineer. The judge pointed out that Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 speaks of obligation of a person enjoying benefits of a non-gratuitous act. It is to be borne in mind that a claim for compensation by one individual against another as per Section 70 of the Act is not based on any subsisting contract. Its basis is that something has been done by one party for the other which the other side has accepted voluntarily, he said and held that a person could claim payment for work done beyond the terms of contract if the other person had availed the benefits of the work. However, pointing out that no document had been filed to prove the removal of over 9 lakh cubic feet of rubble, the judge directed the Railways to pay the amount to the contractor for removing 6.17 lakh cubic feet at the rate of Rs.284 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Dispute over money There, Lal and his relative had a dispute over money transaction. The police said that Lals uncle Jose had earlier taken the initiative of selling a property at Erumeli that had belonged to Lals mother.

Antony said on Sunday. We are handling it in an appropriate manner. We will pursue it and now we are pursuing it with Pakistan, he told reporters here after laying a wreath at the Amar Jawan Jyoti to commemorate the 41st anniversary of the Indian victory in the 1971 war with Pakistan. The Minister was asked if India was pushing for a probe by Pakistan into the death of Captain Kalia. Captain Kalias father N.K. Kalia has taken up the case with the United Nations Human Rights Commission for a direction to Pakistan to probe the death of his son. He has also filed a plea in the Supreme Court to direct the government to take up the case of his sons torture at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at the Hague. The Supreme Court had on Friday sought response from the Centre on Mr. Kalias plea. However, India is not in favour of taking the matter to ICJ as it feels that it is a bilateral issue and it has always maintained that there should be non-interference by ICJ in bilateral or internal matters. India Gate is the right place to build a national war memorial, Mr. Antony has said, against the backdrop of opposition by Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit to the proposal. As far as we are concerned, this [India Gate] is the place to have a war memorial. We are very clear, he told reporters.  PTI  OPEN",

Some 2,000 people are believed to have been duped already. They were given fake appointment letters and even laminated ID cards. We have arrested four persons who were involved in forging official documents and cheating persons by claiming to provide them with jobs. The investigations into the matter are in progress and it is likely that others will be arrested, Amar Kanti Sarkar, the additional director general of Railways in the State, told The Hindu . He said that several fraudulent documents including forms, appointment letters and identity cards had been recovered from the accused persons. Sources said that the elaborate scam, which involved high-quality forgeries of documents that are involved during the recruitment process, had duped nearly 2,000 persons and the fraudsters had managed to siphon off about Rs.4.5 crore in the process. The arrests were made in the course of raids following a complaint registered by five youths who are residents of the States Birbhum district. They claimed that they had being asked to pay Rs.20,000 each and provided with several documents including appointment letters and identity cards. They had also been told that they would have to clear a medical examination, sources said. It was only when these youth reached the B. R. Singh Hospital of the Eastern Railway to report for the medical examination (as they were told to) that they realised that all the documents they were carrying were fraudulent and that they were victims of an elaborate scam, they said.

        "content": " Belying apprehensions of possible trouble, the Congress day-long brain-storming session here on Sunday went off uneventfully, after the leadership tactfully pre-empted the strategy of Telangana leaders to raise the statehood issue. AP Congress Committee chief Botcha Satyanarayana took the initiative when he himself appealed to the Centre to amicably resolve the Telangana imbroglio at the earliest. Once this hurdle was overcome, the top leadership used the platform to motivate party men to impress people in the run-up to the 2014 Assembly elections about the series of programmes launched for their welfare. Azad optimistic The Congress can repeat the 2004 Assembly and Parliament election results if we stay united and effectively take the schemes to people at the grassroot level, AICC general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad said. Significantly, he made no mention of the Telangana issue in his 45-minute speech, while Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy too avoided any reference to the problem. His remark comes at a time when the party is deeply worried that the people were not considering the welfare schemes as Congress Governments own, those like Arogyasri in particular, but as YSRs. Many of the 60 leaders who addressed the gathering sought to take credit for the recent enactment of the SC/ST Sub Plan. Some like Ponnam Prabhakar and Anjan Kumar Yadav, MPs, sought similar legislation for Backward Classes and minorities. There were complaints galore that the party leadership was ignoring cadre by not rewarding them with nominated posts. Mr. Azad had to intervene at one stage to advise the State leadership to put an end to closed-door meetings. They should focus on endearing themselves to the cadre by holding district-level meetings. Mr. Kiran Kumar Reddy, who gave the concluding speech, tried to enthuse the cadre with a promise of filling the nominated posts in right earnest before the deadline of January 14, Sankranti. However, Mr. Satyanarayana made a mark on the meeting as he was successful in bringing leaders from three regions on a single platform. The meeting, however, failed to give a direction to second rung leaders and cadre on checking the exodus of MLAs and other leaders to the YSRC and TRS.  OPEN",

Alleging that the Government of India allowed the NIA to issue summons, NSCN (IM) Chairman Isak Chisi Swu said the best way forward is to settle differences across the table.

A majority of them have complained of irritation in the eyes, throat discomfort and respiratory problem. While four of the persons who suffered minor burns have been admitted to a private hospitals others are undergoing treatment in the Cuddalore Government Headquarters Hospitals. None of their condition is said to be serious. The local people told this Correspondent that they saw flames leaping above the height of the compound wall and heard loud explosion. Soon, the company premises were engulfed with dark smoke and fanned with the winds the smoke spread to the nearby villages. The residents of the Sonaganchavadi village, just about one-and-half kilometre from the company, were affected the most because of the proximity factor. They mainly complained of eye irritation and breathing problems. Soon after the fire incident a substantial number of the residents of Sonaganchavdi went to their relatives places as a safety measure. For some time, panic gripped the people in the surrounding villages and only when the fire service personnel doused the flames they heaved a sigh of relief. As a large number of people gathered in the vicinity of the company and fire tenders were making hurried trips, the traffic on the Cuddalore-Chidambaram road got affected. On information, Divisional Fire Officer A. Kumarasamy mobilised seven fire engines to extinguish the flames with the help of water and foam guns. He told TheHindu that two fire service personnel, namely Mahendran and Balakumaran attached to the SIPCOT Industrial Estate Fire Station, who were in the thick of the smoke, got suffocated and swooned. They were immediately shifted to the government hospital. Mr. Kumarasamy said that it was learnt that when an employee of the company was filling diesel in the oil engine some of the fuel spilled and fell on the exhaust of the engine sparking the fire. Soon the fire spread to the chemical barrels containing hydrogen peroxide. However, with alacrity the fire service personnel removed quite a number of barrels before they too caught fire. Another version had it that when the labourers were unloading the chemical barrels from a container one of the barrels accidentally fell on the floor and got exploded, triggering the fire. On information District Collector Rajendra Ratnoo and Superintendent of Police A. Radhika rushed to the spot to make rescue arrangements. Mr. Ratnoo told this Correspondent that no sooner than he received the news did he put in place a contingency plan. Besides deploying adequate number of fire tenders, the State Transport Corporation buses too were kept ready, in case any evacuation of the people in the nearby villages was needed. He assured the people of Songanchavadi that if they were so desirous he would arrange for their accommodation and food in a safe and secure place. The Collector also said that he had instructed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board officials to monitor the air quality to study whether there was any trace of toxic materials. He had also informed the medical fraternity the characteristics of hydrogen peroxide so they could immediately provide proper health care. Environment Minister M.C.

Sivathanu, a 61-year-old resident of Baba Nagar 6{+t}{+h}street in Rajamangalam, has been giving away Rs. 50 and a biscuit packet to beggars every Saturday. Every Friday night, beggars from Arakonnam, Tiruvallur and even neighbouring states, gather in the locality. According to residents of the area, their number has now reached about 1,500, and they cause a ruckus in the locality every week. There are over 4,000 residents living in 13 streets in Baba Nagar. The beggars sit in front of the houses and start drinking. Many defecate there. Women also do not venture out then as they fear harassment, said S. Dharmaraj, former vice president of Baba Nagar Residents Welfare Association. Several attempts to prevent this gathering have ended in broken car and bike mirrors, he added. Assistant commissioner of police, Villivakkam, K. Kannan said that six months ago the police organised a meeting between Mr. Sivathanu and the other residents. I told him I would find an open plot for him, as what he does is charity. I also promised to post two policemen to regulate the crowd. But he refused our offer, he said. This Saturday morning, fed-up residents stepped in to stop the crowd. They blocked all three entries to Baba Nagar 6{+t}{+h}street. A ruckus ensued, and subsequently, the police arrived. The beggars were asked to leave. One man snatched a womans gold chain and ran away. We caught him and handed him over to the police. said Mr. Dharmaraj. The police found that his name was Kuriakose, and that he was from Kerala. He had arrived in the area on hearing about the alms. Mr. Sivathanu told The Hindu that this act of charity was being conducted through the Sivathanu Charitable Trust. No one has the right to stop me from donating money to the poor and needy. If residents have a problem they should give a written complaint. Then I can take the matter to the court and let the law decide, he said. He added that while claiming to put an end to the nuisance the police had indulged in human rights violations by hurting physically challenged persons. If some mendicants cause a nuisance, they can be sent away. There was no reason to chase everyone out, he added.

Lokayukta Superintendent of Police D.S. Jagamainavar said Ms. Aadilakshmi allegedly demanded Rs. 5,000 from Yatish Baikampady, who runs a resort at the Panambur beach. The bribe was to favour Mr. Baikampady in the tenders called for development of Thannirbhavi beach. Mr. Baikampady was among the many who had bid for the tender. Mr. Jagamainavar said Ms. Aadilakshmi allegedly made the demand on Wednesday and asked Mr. Baikampady to give the money when she visited the latter's beach resort on Thursday. Mr. Baikampady filed a complaint with the Lokayukta police on Thursday. A police team led by Udaya M. Naik caught Ms. Aadilakshmi while she was allegedly receiving the money. Mr. Jagamainavar said Ms. Aadilakshmi was having jurisdiction over Mangalore, Shimoga, Chikmagalur and Udupi districts. She was a native of Mysore and had two more years of service in the department, he said. She had been accused of committing the offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The Karnataka State Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation had called in December 2010 for technical bid for development of the Thannirbhavi beach on the public-private partnership. Among the facilities that the State Government had planned included developing a golf course and a marine aquarium park, according to N. Yogish Bhat, Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. The Tourism Department had no role to play in tendering process, he said. Mr. Baikampady said he was among the seven persons who had submitted tenders. A committee headed by Mangalore City Corporation Commissioner K.N. Vijayaprakash was scrutinising the applications. It is said Ms. Aadilakshmi demanded a bribe of Rs. 10,000 from Mr. Baikampady and then agreed for Rs. 5,000. She demanded money although she did not have any role in the tendering process, he said.

        "content": " Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asked Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday to hold a detailed press conference at the earliest to clarify the government's position on the black money issue and what it was doing to deal with the menace. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court sought clarity from the government on how it intended to end black money, and wanted to know why it could not reveal the names of people who had stashed away huge sums in foreign banks. This has added fuel to the sustained criticism of the government by the Opposition as well as the rash of reports in the media, together creating the impression that the government has something to hide. The matter came up at Thursday's Cabinet meeting during a discussion on a proposed tax agreement with the Cayman Islands. The Prime Minister himself raised the subject and expressed concern at the government taking a beating on black money. Dr. Singh then asked Mr. Mukherjee about the progress on the issue, sources said. Later, Dr. Singh asked Mr. Mukherjee to also find out from Solicitor-General Gopal Subramaniam whether the court's observations were a result of the government's counsel failing to put across its case effectively or whether they just emerged from the Bench. Won't publish names' Sources said that Mr. Mukherjee told the Cabinet that the government had received information about black money accounts in foreign banks on the basis of international treaties that it had signed, and that if such information was made public, no government would share such details in the future. He stressed that foreign governments had shared this information purely for taxation purposes, and the government intended to honour that provision and not make public the names of the account holders. Mr. Mukherjee added that if the court so wished, it could reveal the names, as they had been given to the court. Indeed, Mr. Subramaniam had furnished in a sealed envelope a list of 26 persons who had accounts with the Liechtenstein Bank. Revisiting bilateral agreements Now the government is in the process of revisiting bilateral agreements with countries that are tax havens to include a provision so that it can secure information on accounts opened by Indian citizens over there. It is learnt that some have already been signed and some are in the works. Much of what Mr. Mukherjee told the Cabinet was what Dr. Singh himself told journalists immediately after Wednesday's swearing-in ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Responding to a question on the court's observations, the Prime Minister said that while he did not know what the court had observed, there was no instant solution to bringing back black money. We have got some information from one location and that has been provided to us for the collection of due taxes. We cannot use that information for any other purpose and that information cannot be made public, he said, as the government had made a commitment not to reveal such information. These were treaty obligations, he stressed, adding: Otherwise, who will respect us?  OPEN",

While essential services such as public transport, electricity and communication systems remained uninterrupted, attendance of staff in Central government establishments was reportedly poor. At least 7,000 agitators, including 1,250 women, were arrested across the State for staging protests, police said. Protesters resorted to a rail-roko in Thanjavur, Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Dindigul, Sivaganga, Tirunelveli,Tuticorin, Erode and Dharmapuri districts. Four incidents of stone throwing on buses were reported in Tirupur and Tirunelveli. However, normal life was not affected in the State. Schools, colleges and State government offices functioned normally. Members of the Tamil Nadu Government Employees Association held a demonstration at Chepauk and Collectorates in other districts. About 1,200 members of the All India Trade Union Congress who staged a demonstration on Anna Salai were taken into custody and released later. In a statement, the All India Bank Officers Association said its members participated in the strike resulting in non-clearance of cheques. Replenishment of cash in ATMs was also affected. The BSNL Employees Union said its members were participating in the strike. They opposed unemployment, disinvestment in public sector, and price hike. The Tamil Nadu Government Employees Union cadres organised demonstrations in Chennai and other places, police sources added.  OPEN",

In her petition filed through counsel C.S. Monica and V.T. Arun Thomas, Premila Kiruba Augustus of Bangalore, submitted that she joined SBI as a clerk-cum-typist on March 1, 1974 at Bangalore Main Branch.

She had completed 24 years of pensionable service. In September 2004, she applied for gratuity, PF and pension. The bank settled the gratuity and PF in 2005. Till date, there was no answer for her demand for pension. As per rules, she had completed over 20 years of pensionable service.

Patnaik has stressed the need for an independent regulatory system to enforce environmental laws and monitor the conservation of biodiversity in the country. Delivering the inaugural address at an international conference on Conservation of Forests, Wildlife, and Ecology organised by the Kerala Law Academy here on Saturday, he said pollution control boards in many States lacked the freedom to function as independent entities. Regulatory authorities had to be independent of the government, he said. Observing that public hearings for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) were often given the go-by, he emphasised the need to ensure independent EIAs. Mr. Patnaik said development could not be at the cost of the environment. He underlined the need to address livelihood concerns while exploiting natural resources for development as well as in the enforcement of environment laws. The distribution of natural resources should serve the common good, he said. Speaking on the theme of the conference, Glen Barry, U.S.- based scientist and founder-president of Ecological Internet, said the world was facing an ecological emergency on an unprecedented scale due to the population boom and overconsumption of resources. He said abrupt climate change had emerged as a major challenge for countries around the world. Highlighting the need to maintain the last remnants of the ecosystem, he said Keralas water, tourism, and development options were at risk if the forests in the State were destroyed. Destroying the ecosystem traps the poor with little scope for improvement. Elephant corridors, Dr. Barry said, were critical to Keralas biosphere. Kerala State Human Rights Commission chairman J.B. Koshy presided. High Court judge A.M. Shaffique; Brussels Frank Fleerackers, Commissioner of the High Council of Justice, Brussels; Lekshmi Nair, Principal, Kerala Law Academy; and V.K.

One of the six succumbed to injuries on his way to the hospital. Initial reports on Tuesday had indicated that the Maoists had fired at the tribal people and killed three of them. The Maoists accompanied by a large group of militia members assembled here on Tuesday afternoon and summoned the members of Bhagata tribes from Saagulu village to attend a panchayat where some 75 Kondu tribals from different villages were also present. At the meeting, Jambri charged members of Bhagata tribe with turning into landlords and directed them to hand over their lands to members of Kondu tribe, most of who had migrated from Odisha, as they did not have any land, a Bhagata tribal Vanjara Gopalakrishna told reporters here on Wednesday. He had objected to the diktat pointing out that they themselves were leading a hand-to-mouth existence and that they hardly had 2-3 acres of land. Further, they had inherited this land from their ancestors and they were not willing to part with it. An argument followed and the Bhagata tribals started to leave the place. Annoyed by the opposition, the Maoists thrashed Gopalakrishna prompting the Bhagata villagers to flee. However, the Maoists chased the villagers and thrashed them, even women and elderly were not spared, Gopalakrishna said. Vanjara Hanumantha Rao who climbed an attic in a house in the village was pulled out and beaten to death, his wife Lakshmi said. Another tribal Boduva Kondaiah was also beaten to death. The bodies were lying in the village even on Wednesday afternoon in the absence of any assistance from any quarter. Slippers and sticks were strewn all over the village. The six who were seriously injured were being carried by villagers in makeshift stretchers on Wednesday afternoon when a police team led by District Superintendent of Police G Srinivas arrived.

The police on Tuesday declared that the three sisters, who went missing on February 14 and were found dead inside a well near the village after two days, were raped and then killed. Meanwhile, villagers from Lakhani, Murmadi and other nearby villages, led by BJP MLA Nana Patole, blocked National Highway No.6 for about five hours on Wednesday demanding CBI inquiry into the case. They expressed anguish over slow investigations by the police . The Maharashtra government has declared a Rs.10 lakh compensation to the family of the three girls. But their mother said she did not want the money.  Instead use it for speedier investigation into the case and catch the culprits, she said. Union Heavy Industries Minister Praful Patel, under whose constituency the village falls, visited the family and demanded that the culprits in this heinous crime should be given stringent punishment. Mr. Patel also said that there should be an inquiry into police laxity as alleged by the villagers and the victims family . When my granddaughters did not return home on February 14, we searched around and at 9 p.m., we went to the Lakhani police station to lodge a complaint.

The police Inspector of Lakhani police station Prakash Munde, who was shifted to Bhandara city on February 17, has been suspended, informed SP Arati Singh. Police have formed ten teams for the investigation into the case. One team has been sent to Rajasthan, after the villagers suspected the role of blanket sellers from Rajasthan. But police sources said the blanket sellers left the village on February 12 and investigation as of now suggested the hand of someone who knew the family closely.  OPEN",

        "content": " The award given by the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-II (KWDT) headed by Justice Brijesh Kumar was against the interests of Andhra Pradesh, very partial towards Karnataka and Maharashtra and it did not consider the grave situation that would emerge in Andhra Pradesh. The award must be challenged in Supreme Court. This was the opinion of the expert committee of the Forum for Action Research and Policy Analysis (FARPA), comprising former Chief Engineers and senior professors from Andhra University, on the impact of the tribunal award. Against principles' The entire technical computations (done by the tribunal) are against the normal principles of hydrology and have to be reworked, the expert committee said. The next review of the award was set for 2050, but it should be reviewed five years from now to make necessary modifications, the expert committee said. While Justice Bachawat in the KWDT-I award of 1976 took into consideration yields available for 78 years and arrived at the dependable yield at 2,060 tmc, regenerated water at 70 tmc (for a total of 2,130 tmc) and left the surplus yield, if any, to AP, the KWDT-II of Justice Brijesh Kumar took the dependable yield as 65 per cent, considering the inflows only of the last 47 years, dependable yield at 2,293 tmc and surplus water at 285 tmc, which it distributed to all the three States instead of one State. Distribution of extra yield and surplus waters to the three States is not in proportion to the cultivable land available in the three States. Instead, importance has been given to Karnataka, said convener of FARPA R.V. Rama Rao on Friday. AP was also affected due to additional allocation of 25 tmc to Maharashtra for the Koyana hydroelectric project. Maharashtra was using 122 tmc for Koyana and Tata projects and discharging it into the Arabian Sea. With the additional allotment, the discharge would go up to 147 tmc, depriving the irrigation needs of other areas, a point AP had been making out. The FARPA expert committee, while pointing out that the level of Almatti dam had been allowed to rise, resulting in additional capacity of 130 tmc, in spite of the Supreme Court fixing its height; wanted the Survey of India to check the bench mark adopted at the dam to verify its levels. A two metre upward shift towards high elevations would completely alter the capacity of the dam and benefit Karnataka more, it said. The FARPA also pointed out that Karnataka had never conceded AP's request to release freshers from Almatti to protect its lower riparian rights. Guidelines for the regulatory authority suggested by the tribunal for maintaining the levels of Almatti and to release water to AP should be formed by the CWC in consultation with AP and Karnataka and an independent authority must be created to release water as per these guidelines. FARPA felt that the Justice Sri Krishna Committee, which was essentially constituted to look after the interests of the various regions in the State, should have waited to take into cognisance the implications and repercussions due to the Krishna water tribunal award.

As the duo screamed in fear, the feline jumped over the 5-foot boundary wall on the adjoining hillock but not before biting Bharat's hand.

By permitting Karnataka to increase the height of Almatti dam, the river water tribunal has put a question mark on the survival of farmers in this region, party district secretary V. Umamaheswara Rao told a press conference. Adverse impact Besides capping the option of a kharif crop, the development was likely to have an adverse impact on Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam projects. Referring to the annual practice of releasing water to the major irrigation projects after ensuring adequate water in these dams, he said failure of monsoon or non-availability of water in Almatti would delay the kharif crop, thus compounding the woes of the farmers. The CPI (M) leader said the government must bring leaders of all parties on to a common platform to protect the interests of the farmers in the State. It should file an appeal before the tribunal seeking proportionate distribution of Krishna water to all the stakeholders. Though the share of Andhra Pradesh had increased from 811 tmcft to 1001 tmcft, the allocated water was likely to come down in actual availability, paving way for a possible drought every three years.

Nobody seems to be aware of the last time when or where a figure of the Father of the Nation was elevated on a pedestal which indicates the considerable lapse of time since the last such event. Mason Katta Latchanna of Rebbenpalli in Dandepalli mandal is among those who wonder why statues of the Mahatma are not preferred these days. The couple of figures of Gandhi he had made some five years ago lie by the side of the road as the Gram Panchayat has failed to build a pedestal to place for one of the two. The sarpanch had placed the order for the statue. He had even paid the money for it in full, recalls Latchanna as he points out towards the image of Gandhi spinning yarn on the wheel. It was a good thing that he opted for a statue to be made locally however, I am sad that it lies wasted. The figure may not be a piece of art but, it should have been installed as a mark of respect to the great man, observes the mason who makes statues besides building houses. An image of the Mahatma on a charkha has rarely been put on a pedestal, according to the artisan. I wanted the one proposed to be put at Rebbenpalli to be different and so worked on it from my childhood memories, he says about the effort that went into making of this reinforced cement concrete idol. Not all the towns in the district have a statue of the apostle of peace. There are many villages, old and new, which could do with a statue of the Mahatma to propagate his memories. The practice of installation of either Gandhi's statues or those of great leaders like Pandit Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri or Netaji Subhash Bose seems to have been discontinued. There are some public places where even idols of religious leaders have been installed by interested groups.

Amir, a native of Ernakulam, Kerala, had taken pictures of Mr. Chidambaram in the portico of Chennai Airport as the latter was about to board an Air India flight to New Delhi. He was remanded at the Puzhal Prison and his relatives had recently moved the Chengalpattu District Sessions Court for bail. The Court said it had no objection provided that the jurisdiction court where the reported offence had taken place, did not object. As the Chennai Airport Police station, where the case was registered, came within the jurisdiction of the Judicial Magistrate, Alandur, the bail petition was transferred there. The matter was brought to the Judicial Magistrate, Tambaram who granted the bail on conditions that two blood relatives of Amir furnished a surety and that he appear before the Airport police station every day at 10 a.m. until further orders. Amir had a couple of cases filed against him elsewhere for taking pictures of airport installations.  OPEN",

On Sunday, Mani had misbehaved with a pavement dweller sleeping in Triplicane and was assaulted by some locals. The maid who works at the couples house saw the incident and informed Padmavathi, said an investigating officer. The couple kept arguing over the matter. Following this, an enraged Padmavathi hit Mani and chopped his body using a kitchen knife and some carpentry tools in the house, the officer added. Padmavathi and Yuvaraj were arrested and remanded to custody by the Manali police who are now probing further.

He is also entitled to costs of Rs. 20,000. Justice K.K. Sasidharan said the TNEB was expected to take all precautionary measures to avoid any untoward incident. It had a statutory duty to maintain the live wire and other electricity system used for transmission. It is not possible to avoid the liability by pleading that the incident was an act of God. The petitioner, G. Ponnusamy, said his son, Vimal, was studying in Standard IV in a Government Middle School at Seemaputhur in Tiruvannamalai district. On August 15, 2010, when he was returning from school, he died of electric shock. On August 12 itself, one Punyakoti, had lodged a complaint with the boards Junior Engineer at Desur, Vandavasi taluk, that the electric wire to his pump-set had got disconnected and the same was lying down in an adjacent property. However, no action was taken by the board. The petitioner submitted a representation to the board claiming compensation. By a communication of May 9, 2011, the Junior Engineer informed him that the incident was nothing but an act of God. Mr. Ponnusamy sought the quashing of the communication as illegal and consequently direct the board to compensate his sons death. Mr. Justice Sasidharan said the board is expected to conduct pre-monsoon inspection for taking preventive measures. The counter did not contain any statement that such an inspection and preventive maintenance schedules for line and equipment had been done. The board had not strengthened the service lines. It was only on account of such negligence, the wire got snapped. The factual matrix gave a clear indication that the board was at fault and the officials had not taken reasonable care and as a result a young boy died. The board was liable to pay compensation to the petitioner.

Further, being on the Committee for the Prevention of Crime Against Women, the AIWC is working for the protection of women and for speedy justice in the redressal of atrocities against women. What is of special significance to the Nilgiris district and to the entire State in the Chief Ministers Plan is the proposal to set up fast-track mahila courts, day-to-day trials, enlisting of women -investigators, and the launch of a help-line for women in distress, she said. She said that the authorities should introduce police-beats in secluded parts of the district, ensure better implementation of help lines, organise sensitisation programmes for police personnel in dealing with rape victims, and enlist women's non-governmental organisations in implementing the action-plan.

        "content": " : Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan on Friday inaugurated the disbursal of enhanced pension and biometric cards to persons afflicted with serious ailments and permanent disabilities suspected to be caused by the aerial spraying of Endosulfan on the cashew estates of the Plantation Corporation of Kerala (PCK) in the district. The biometric card will make them eligible to get specialised medical treatment free of cost. Mr. Achuthanandan said unscientific and prolonged spraying of the pesticide had resulted in untold hardship to those living close to the cashew estates and led to mental and physical retardation and a host of genetic deformity among them. Stating that the Union government had the responsibility to provide matching relief to the affected people, he said the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government had sought a Rs.100-crore financial assistance from the Centre for the purpose. He said the LDF government had declared a comprehensive package to rehabilitate the victims and enhanced the pension to Rs.2,000 from Rs.300 for bedridden persons and Rs.1,000 for physically and mentally challenged victims. The government, after carrying out a detailed survey on the victims' health conditions, had decided the mode of treatment with the assistance of expert doctors drawn from various specialty hospitals. The digital biometric cards will make them eligible to get medical treatment from various hospitals free of cost, Mr. Achuthanandan said. On the basis of reports, the government had decided to take stern steps to ban the use of Endosulfan in Palakkad and Idukki districts, he said. Presiding over the function, Health Minister P.K. Sreemathy said the government, by coming out with a comprehensive relief package, had virtually adopted the affected families right from 2006 when the CPI(M)-led government came to power in the State. Having completed a detailed survey of the affected victims and their families, the government was open to accommodating fresh persons on the official list of Endosulfan victims. Revenue Minister K.P. Rajendran; P. Karunakaran, MP; Pallipram Balan, C.H. Kunhambu, K.V. Kunhiraman and K Kunhiraman, MLAs; district panchayat president P.P. Shyamala Devi; District Collector Anand Singh; and Director of Social Welfare Department Dinesh Arora; were among those who attended the function held at Government High School here.

        "content": " Even as the entire nation is rallying behind the Delhi gang-rape victim and crying for stringent laws, a poor woman from the city who was raped allegedly by two persons last year is living in constant fear and awaiting justice. Her only fault: she dared to complain against those who sexually assaulted her. They (the accused) constantly abuse me over phone and threaten to kill me and my children, she says. It was on March 12 last year the woman first approached the police complaining that Azam and Chand, who reside near Dabeerpura, had taken Rs. 20,000 from her promising to get a house allotted under the Indiramma scheme. I demanded that they return my money when they failed to get the sanction for the house and approached the Rein Bazaar police. The police summoned them and took an undertaking for returning the money. But soon after, Azam and Chand called me on the pretext of settling the matter. They confined me to a house, beat me up and raped me, the 30-year-old woman recounts. The next morning, she lodged a complaint at Dabeerpura station against Azam, Chand and four others -- Imran, Syed Mohammed, Hasmath and Naser. The accused six were arrested after they were framed under rape charges (crime number 56/2012) under sections 376, 354, 506, 109 (read with 34) of Criminal Law Amendment Act. But then, her travails mounted after the arrested persons came out on bail. She claims they began harassing and threatening her. Their threats intensified as she was summoned to the police station. The woman had another problem on her hand: she did not want people of the locality to know that she was raped. She stopped working at a beauty parlour in , as the accused persons used to come and pester her. They started calling on her phone. The threats got louder. They would threaten to kill her four children and her too. Changing the phone number did not help her. Despite changing two telephone numbers, I was getting the threat calls, recalls the hapless woman. She knocked the Saidabad police doors again, only to be told that she change the phone number again to avoid harassment. Here she faced another predicament: the Dabeerpura police, who are investigating the rape case, wanted her to retain the same number since it was in police and court records. When contacted, the Dabeerpura Inspector, D.V. Ranga Reddy, said that all the accused were arrested and charge-sheeted. Trial will begin soon, he said. On her complaint of threat calls, he says a formal complaint has to be lodged at the police station area in which she lives now. Noorjahan Siddiqui, a counsellor at My Choices, an NGO in the Old City, says in many cases the poor rape victims do not lodge complaints for fear of harassment. Even if a complaint is lodged, the case is not taken to its logical conclusion on account of poverty and illiteracy, says Ms. Siddiqui. The distressed woman ekes out her living by working as a house maid.  They confined me to a house, beat me up and raped me. Now, they constantly abuse me over phone and threaten to kill me and my children  OPEN",

        "content": " The Supreme Court on Friday sought the response of the Union and the Andhra Pradesh governments on two petitions seeking a judicial inquiry into the alleged encounter killings of Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad, spokesperson of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), and journalist Hemchandra Pandey by the Andhra Pradesh police on the night of July 1 last year. A Bench of Justices Aftab Alam and R.M. Lodha issued the notice, returnable in six weeks, after hearing counsel Prashant Bhushan, appearing for petitioners Swami Agnivesh and Pandey's wife Bineeta Pandey. Justice Alam orally observed: Our Republic cannot bear the stain to kill its own children. We will issue notice. They will have to respond. We hope there will be good and convincing answer to the questions [raised in the petitions]. Not genuine encounter' The petitioners said the post mortem reports and fact-finding carried out by the Coordination of Democratic Rights Organisations (CDRO) clearly indicated that it was not a genuine encounter and that Azad and Pandey were killed in blatant violation of their rights under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. Azad was carrying a letter from Swami Agnivesh for peace talks when he was taken into custody along with Pandey. Violation of Article 21 Then Swami Agnivesh sent a letter to Azad, suggesting three possible dates for starting a 72-hour suspension of armed resistance by the CPI (Maoist) and simultaneous cessation of action by the government forces. During that period, the government would invite Maoists for talks and initiate a mutual ceasefire agreement, the petitioners said. However, on the intervening night of July 1-2, both Azad and Pandey were killed. According to the CPI (Maoist), Azad was scheduled to meet local contact Sahadev in Nagpur at 11 a.m. on July 1 and travel to the Dandakaranya forests for meeting senior Maoists to discuss Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram's proposal and likely dates for a ceasefire. But he never turned up for the meeting. Violation of Article 21 The alleged encounter, if proved fake  as indicated by the CDRO report  is in blatant violation of Article 21. The refusal to initiate an inquiry, despite questions raised about the veracity of a police investigation by human rights activists, organisations and sections of the media, and the disruption it caused to the peace process initiated by the Home Minister himself were unreasonable and arbitrary and raised serious questions about the bona fides of the Home Ministry, the petitioners said. Demand rejected Further, the Andhra Pradesh police acted in blatant violation of the revised NHRC (National Human Rights Commission) guidelines on encounters by not registering an FIR (first information report) on the alleged encounter and by not handing over the investigation to the State CB-CID. Swami Agnivesh (first petitioner) pointed out that he met the Home Minister, who, however, turned down his demand for a judicialinquiry. The Minister's stand was that such a step could be taken only by the Andhra Pradesh government as the encounter took place in Adilabad.

        "content": " Over 55 people were killed at Pulmedu near Vandiperiyar in Kerala's Idukki district on Friday night, the climactic day of the Sabarimala pilgrimage season, in a series of tragic incidents. The bizarre sequence apparently began after at least one accident involving a bus or a jeep, and led to a panic reaction verging on a stampede among pilgrims in the forested and hilly area. About 90 people were believed to have been injured. Some early accounts spoke of a much higher death toll. (A PTI report put the death toll 90 and the number of injured at 100) The tragedy occurred between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. The pilgrims were returning after witnessing the Makara Jyothi.' It was believed that a number of them are from Tamil Nadu. The accident spot was close to the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. The weeks-long Makaravilakku season was particularly crowded this time and major traffic hold-ups had been reported over the past few days. Sabarimala attracts hundreds of thousands of pilgrims through most part of the year from different parts of the country, mainly from the south. The incident occurred in a remote forest track leading from Pulmedu to Kumily. Initial reports reaching the State capital suggested that a vehicle carrying pilgrims rammed another and overturned. This reportedly triggered a stampede in the area choked with tens of thousands of devotees. Health Minister P.K. Sreemathy told The Hindu that ambulances and doctors from five nearby districts have been rushed to the Vandiperiyar government hospital. Medical College Hospitals in the State were put on alert, she said. According to police officials, the presence of tens of thousands of pilgrims was hampering the movement of rescue workers to and from the accident site. The absence of electricity in the area was proving to be an added difficulty. In a major tragedy in 1999, some 53 people were killed at the Sabarimala base camp after the collapse of the sides of a hillock set off a panic reaction. among pilgrims in a crowded situation. District authorities have opened a control room in Kumily. The telephone number is 04869-222049.  OPEN",

        "content": " The Yeddyuruppa Government, which is under fire from the Opposition for illegally denotifying land in and around Bangalore and allotting sites to a favoured few, suffered further embarrassment when the Karnataka High Court stayed the proceedings of the Justice B. Padmaraj Commission of Inquiry. In staying the proceedings of the commission appointed by the State Government to look into denotification of land during the past several years, the High Court subtly indicated that it preferred a probe by the Lokayukta into the issue. Challenged The High Court was dealing with a petition by Janata Dal (Secular) spokesperson Y.S.V. Datta who had challenged the decision of the Government to institute a judicial inquiry even as the Lokayukta had commenced a probe. When the case came up on Friday, Additional Advocate-General K.M. Nataraj clearly indicated that the State Government was in favour of a probe into the issue by the commission. Cabinet decision He said the decision to appoint the commission to go into denotification of land had been taken by the Cabinet. Mr. Nataraj said the State Government had subsequently issued a Government Order constituting the commission and publishing the terms of reference. He indicated that the commission had a wider ambit to cover than the investigation by the Lokayukta. The Government had the power and the jurisdiction in ordering such an inquiry, he said. On his part, senior counsel Ravi Verma Kumar, appearing for Mr. Datta, described the action of the State in appointing a commission as an attempt to derail the Lokayukta probe. He said there was no necessity for another probe when the Lokayukta was seized of the matter. Moreover, if the commission began work, it would come in the way of the Lokayukta probe. He urged the court to stay the probe by the commission and allow the Lokayukta to freely investigate the complaints lodged by the JD(S) against the Chief Minister and the Government. When the Lokayukta had already commenced investigation, how could the Government order a parallel inquiry, he asked. The court stayed for four weeks proceedings by the commission. It asked the State to file its objections in three weeks and ordered issue of notice to the commission.

        "content": " A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a Coptic church in Egypt on Saturday, killing 21 people and wounding 79 in an attack President Hosni Mubarak said was the work of foreign hands. There was no immediate claim, but Al-Qaeda has called for punishment of Egypt's Copts over claims that two priests' wives they say had converted to Islam were being held by the church against their will. The bombing in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria sparked fierce anger among Christians, who clashed with police and shouted slogans against the government. A Health Ministry official said 21 people were killed and 79 wounded, and the Interior Ministry said eight of those injured were Muslims. A witness had told a private television he saw a car park outside the Al-Qiddissin (The Saints) church shortly after midnight, two men get out and the explosion happen immediately afterwards. But the Interior Ministry ruled out the hypotheses of a car bomb, saying it was probable that the bomb... was carried by a suicide bomber who died among the crowd. The device was packed with pieces of metal to cause the maximum amount of harm, it added. Mr. Mubarak echoed that, saying the bombing bore the hallmark of foreign hands. Some 15 hours after the bombing, growing numbers of Christians were continuing to vent their anger. By mid-afternoon, hundreds of youths in small groups in the neighbourhood of the church were showering rocks and bottles on police, who responded with tear gas and rubber-coated bullets. The attack comes two months after gunmen stormed a Baghdad cathedral in an operation that left 44 worshippers, two priests and seven security forces dead. That was claimed by Al-Qaeda's Iraq affiliate, the Islamic State of Iraq, which said its purpose was to force the release of the two women in Egypt. The Copts account for up to 10 per cent of Egypt's 80-million population, and often complain of discrimination and have been the target of sectarian attacks.  AFP  OPEN",

        "content": " Lashkar-e-Taiba operative David Headley, who scouted targets in Mumbai for the 26/11 attacks, was a Pakistani spy working for Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), whose chief Lieutenant-General Ahmed Shuja Pasha was possibly aware of the plot to strike India's financial hub, claims an investigative news report. In essence, U.S. and Indian officials say, Headley was more than a terrorist: He served as a Pakistani spy, investigative American journalist Sebastian Rotella writes in ProPublica.Com. Investigation into the Mumbai terrorist attacks by the U.S. and Indian agencies, says the news report, has for the first time given a detailed account of how the powerful ISI has been playing the double game: acting as a front-line U.S. ally in the fight against terror while supporting selected terrorist groups which serve Pakistani interests. Documents about the Mumbai attacks investigation in the possession of ProPublica.Com build a strong case that officers in the ISI Directorate collaborated with the LeT in the Mumbai terror plot, Mr. Rotella writes. Officials from both countries [India and the U.S.] say they are persuaded that ISI officers recruited and trained Headley in spying techniques and gave him money and instructions to scout targets in Mumbai and elsewhere. Headley has told investigators that a Pakistani navy frogman helped plan the maritime attack on Mumbai, says the news report, citing a 119-page report recounting Headley's interrogation this year by Indian authorities obtained by ProPublica. Pasha visited Lakhvi In a potentially significant revelation, ProPublica reports that Headley said ISI Director-General Lieutenant-General Pasha went to see LeT military chief Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi in custody after he was arrested post-26/11. Pasha had visited him to understand the Mumbai attack conspiracy, the report quotes Headley as saying, without further elaboration. Pakistani officials deny that the spymaster made the jailhouse visit. U.S. and Indian officials and experts are more willing to believe the story, it said. I think Pasha was aware of the plot beforehand, or he is not chief of the ISI, an Indian counter-terror official is quoted as saying. The ProPublica report, however, says U.S. counter-terrorism officials do not see evidence that ISI chiefs made an institutional, top-down decision to attack Mumbai. Some feel that Headley's nuanced, sometimes ambiguous narrative tends to exonerate the top spymasters. Headley told investigators that the ISI's Director-General was apparently caught off-guard by the carnage in Mumbai, the report said. The investigators believe Headley's main handler, a man identified only as Major Iqbal, was a serving member of ISI and one of several Pakistani intelligence officers who had contact with Headley, according to U.S. officials. According to ProPublica, Major Iqbal assigned a non-commissioned officer (NCO) to give Headley standard intelligence training. Headley learnt techniques for detecting surveillance, developing sources and practised with the lower-ranking officer on the streets of Lahore. The specialised training lasted several months and continued intermittently. I became close to Major Iqbal, Headley told interrogators. The training given by this NCO under the guidance of Major Iqbal was much more scientific and effective than the trainings I did in the LeT camps. Phone and e-mail evidence have corroborated Headley's contact with Major Iqbal and other suspected ISI officers, say U.S. and Indian officials say. ISI officers supplied a boat for a failed first attempt to send the gunmen to Mumbai and intervened when Headley's chaotic personal life got him in trouble just two months before the attacks, the report says. Headley said the Mumbai plot caused  and resulted from  conflict in the Lashkar-ISI partnership. Disillusioned militants demanding a bigger role in fighting in Afghanistan were defecting to Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, while chiefs of Lashkar and the ISI tried to keep the main focus on Kashmir, he said. In response to the dangerous internal rifts, Lashkar decided on a spectacular Al-Qaeda-style strike on Western targets in Mumbai, and the ISI approved the shift in tactics, Headley explained. The ISI I believe had no ambiguity of understanding the necessity to strike India [and]... shifting and minimising the theatre of violence from the domestic soil of Pakistan, he said.

According to Delhi Police sources, the two suspected members of the Indian Mujahideen who were arrested from Hyderabad in October 2012 told interrogators that they had conducted reconnaissance of different parts of Hyderabad in July.

Eyewitness accounts recall two blasts between 6.45 p.m. and 7 p.m. near the Konark theatre and Dilsukhnagar bus-stop, respectively, resulting in widespread mayhem. After the first blast near the bus-stop, panicky crowds rushed towards the Konark theatre before the second bomb went off near a small tiffin centre opposite the theatre. M. Naresh, an MBA student who worked as an intern in an IT consultancy nearby, recalled having seen 20 to 30 people with bleeding injuries running towards a private hospital, soon after the second blast. Five to six mangled bodies were found lying there. The first blast near the bus-stop was no less horrific. I heard a big explosion around 7 p.m. Smoke enveloped the whole area, and after it cleared, I could see six to seven people bleeding profusely. Limbs were broken and for some, the intestines had been ripped out. Soon, they were shifted to hospital, recounted L. Narsing Rao from Vani Leather Shop near the bus-stop. Rakesh, another shopkeeper, said many people had gathered outside a watch repair shop when the blast happened. Most of them fell down. The impact was so powerful that mirrors and glass doors of shops up to the third floor of the Giriji Lokeshnand Complex where the incident happened, were shattered totally. A shop named Dress Code received the maximum impact near the location. Two youngsters Rafi, 24 and Laddu, 26 who sat on the steps of the shop were seriously injured. Viewers inside the Konark theatre rushed out as the floor under their feet shook due to the blast impact. Chaos prevailed at the blast location in Dilsukhnagar. Police forced closure of shops, as rumours were rife about more bombs at other locations. Phones were jammed, and SMSs could not be sent out. Parents frantically calling their wards could not connect immediately, resulting in widespread panic.    OPEN",

In Haryana, bus driver and All India Trade Union Congress treasurer Narender Singh was killed when he tried to stop a bus which was being taken out of the Ambala Depot, Inder Singh Bhadana, district president of the Haryana Roadways Workers Union, said. After the incident, other workers damaged vehicles belonging to the Deputy Commissioner of Police and the Station House Officer of the Baldev police station area, the police said. Earlier, AITUC general secretary Gurudas Dasgupta told PTI that the victim was allegedly stabbed to death by some persons who wanted to take out buses from the depot. Commuters in New Delhi faced hardships as many auto-rickshaws and taxis went off the road. Though Metro services were not affected, bus services were partially hit as several unions extended support to the strike. Eleven unions have called the strike to demand urgent steps to check price rise, strictly enforce labour laws in workplaces, provide social security to workers of the unorganised sector, end disinvestment in the Public Sector Undertakings and raise the minimum wage to Rs. 10,000. The strike affected public transport services in Punjab and Haryana as a majority of the government-owned buses operating on inter-State routes went off the roads. In Maharashtra, the financial sector was hit as bank employees joined the strike. There was little impact in West Bengal. Shops and markets were mostly open in Kolkata. Fewer private buses and taxis operated, but the government-owned buses ran normally. Except blockades in the Hasnabad and Diamond sections of Eastern Railway, train services were normal in the Howrah and Sealdah divisions. The State government had warned employees against going on strike and asked shops and markets to remain open or face action, including cancellation of licence. In Odisha, commuters faced difficulties as buses, taxis and auto-rickshaws did not ply, leaving a large number of passengers stranded. Shops, markets, business establishments, petrol pumps and restaurants remained closed and roads wore a deserted look, official sources said. Train services were disrupted as protesters blocked the track at many places, including Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Balasore, Khurda Road, Berhampur and Sambalpur, railway sources said. Life was affected in the Left Front-ruled Tripura. Shops and markets were closed, as were schools, colleges and banks. Private buses and taxis went off the road and train service came to a standstill. CITU workers staged a dharna on the track at the Agartala station. In Andhra Pradesh, workers of various public sector undertakings stayed away from work. The employees of various public sector banks staged a protest on Bank Street at Koti in Hyderabad.  Except stray incidents of stone-pelting in Bellary, the strike call evoked a mixed response in Karnataka. The strike hit life across Kerala, as employees of many sectors, including transport and banking, stayed away from work. Early reports said buses and taxis went off the road and shops and restaurants remained closed. Train services were not affected.  PTI  OPEN ",

        "content": " A court here on Saturday took cognisance of the charge sheet filed by the police in the Delhi gang-rape case and issued production warrants to summon the five accused from the Tihar Central Jail on Monday to start pre-trial proceedings. Additional Public Prosecutor Rajiv Mohan told the court that the Delhi Central Forensic Science Laboratorys DNA report indicates that the victims blood samples tallied with the blood stains on the clothes of all the accused. A piece of the victims dress, which one of the accused had burnt, was recovered from the ashes at his instance, and blood stains on it tallied with her blood sample. Metropolitan Magistrate Namrita Aggarwal said that prima facie offences under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 376(2)(g) (gang rape), 377 (unnatural offences), 365 (kidnapping), 394 (causing hurt in committing robbery), 395 (dacoity), 396 (dacoity with murder), 201 (destruction of evidence), 120B (conspiracy), 34 (common intention) and 412 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of the Indian Penal Code were made out against all the accused. On Monday, copies of the charge sheet would be supplied to Ram Singh, Mukesh Singh, Pawan Kumar, Akshay Singh and Vinay Sharma. The committing of the case to the sessions fast-track court would depend on the time taken for scrutiny of documents. The sixth accused is being treated as a juvenile and the investigating officer is expected to appear before a Juvenile Justice Board on Monday afternoon. After filing an electronic copy of the charge sheet in court, Mr. Mohan said statements of the physiotherapy student and her male friend, the DNA report furnished by CFSL, Delhi, and medical records from Safdarjung Hospital supported the charges that the Delhi Police wanted framed against the accused. The girl died due to septicaemia arising from multiple organ failure caused by multiple injuries. The death summary submitted by the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore, was correlated by Safdarjung Hospital, where she had been treated till December 26. Mr. Mohan said the charges of dacoity, dacoity with murder, and causing hurt while committing robbery on December 16 last were supported by the fact that the accused were more than five in number and articles they robbed from the two victims were recovered at their own instance. The charge sheet, which names 80 witnesses and contains a list of 12 items of evidence, was ordered to be kept sealed upon the prosecution request to protect the girls identity. Mr. Mohan later told journalists that the post-mortem report was expected by January 20 and it would reveal the brutality of the crime and the manner in which it was committed. The police were waiting for a report on tooth bites inflicted by the girl on three of the accused while she fought to save herself. The police would take some more time to file the charge sheet against the juvenile accused as the court concerned would first go through the bone ossification test report and related documents to be sure of his age, the prosecutor said. Meanwhile, a man in saffron robes, claiming to be the founder of an organisation for rape victims, moved an application in the same court praying that details of the victim be made public and the copies of the charge sheet be supplied to the media. When Mr. Mohan asked him what his locus was to intervene in the matter, he told the magistrate: I am a citizen of India and the girl who was gang-raped and murdered was a daughter of the nation. Her male friend had appeared on television yesterday [Friday]. So there is nothing to hide now. The prosecutor sought dismissal of the application and informed the court that a case had been lodged against the news channel which aired the interview of the male friend. The police faced embarrassment in court when they pointed out to the magistrate that the most important charge  Section 302  was inadvertently left out on the cover page of the charge sheet. The prosecutor said it was a typographic error but other parts of the charge sheet mentioned the murder charge and he offered to move a fresh application to correct the error. The magistrate said this was not necessary and the charge sheet would be read as a whole.

You, media, you have defamed our village. Just get out from our area, said Muhammad Zaman, a farmer, who asked his fellow-villagers gathered on the road to attack the assembled journalists and snatch their cameras and equipment if they did not leave. When Kasabs origins were traced to Faridkot in 2008, just a few days after he was arrested in Mumbai, this West Punjab village found itself on the international map for all the wrong reasons. But after his family  parents, two sisters and a brother  went away from here, it was easier to forget that association. People here thought they had closed that chapter for good. On Wednesday, it all came back to them as journalists again descended on the village, 140 km from Lahore. Villagers gathered on the main approach road to prevent journalists from entering. They tried to snatch television cameras and even attacked a TV van. One of them, a landlord, could be seen calling people on his phone, asking them not to allow any media to enter the streets and instructed the locals not to speak to any reporter. This is an Indian conspiracy to defame Pakistan. We have no link with Kasab. We have no sympathy for him. India wants to defame Pakistan with such acts, said local politician Ghulam Mustafa Wattoo of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz). Though we are against such acts of hanging, we think this is the Indian government and judiciarys decision. This is an internal matter of India. The village, situated off the historic Grand Trunk Road, has about 10,000 people, most of them uneducated and poor. Despite the hostile reception to the media, this reporter managed to speak to some of them. One elderly man, who gave his name as Muhammed Manzoor, said the media was paying too much attention to the issue. Asked about Kasabs hanging, he said: He met his fate. As you sow so shall you reap. But he went on to say that the people in the village believe that this Ajmal must be from Faridkot on the Indian side of Punjab. Such reports linking his roots to this village are a deliberate attempt by enemy India. India might be thinking of using this as a pretext to conduct surgical strikes in Pakistan but its just their daydream. Some journalists who visited the village earlier this month ahead of the fourth anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks also encountered a similar unwillingness to acknowledge that Kasab belonged to Faridkot, or to even speak about him or his family.

The Bench said: A recent incident, widely reported in the Press, resulting in the death of two persons, allegedly on account of use of firearms by some private security personnel, is a matter of grave concern. Some questions need to be urgently addressed: What is the legal regulatory framework under which private security agencies operate? What are the parameters/norms that are considered for issue of firearm/weapon licences to private security personnel? What are the guidelines, if any, governing the use of firearms/weapons by them; if not, is it necessary to frame definite parameters? What are the rights and duties of private agencies under the law, particularly, vis a vis the criminal law of the land? Under these circumstances, the Bench added, we take suo motu cognisance of the said reports relating to the licensing and working of private agencies We issue notice to the Ministry with a direction to file an affidavit explaining its stand on these broad questions within two weeks.

The humanitarian aid caravan which began its journey from Rajghat in New Delhi has now passed through Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon and Syria. However, the relief material that is to be shipped from the Syrian port of Latakia to Al Arish in Egypt cannot be moved because of Cairo's refusal to grant visas to Iranian nationals who are part of the caravan, said a statement from the New Trade Union Initiative (NTUI), the organisers of this trans-Asia event. Egypt and Iran have a tense political relationship, which had once led Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to accuse the Egyptian government of being a partner in crimes in Gaza. During its journey, the caravan has grown to reach a strength of 164 members. Out of these, 60 are from India, 32 from Jordan, 20 from Iran, 13 from Indonesia, 10 from Lebanon, nine from Pakistan, six from Turkey, four from Bahrain, three from Malaysia, two each from Japan and Bangladesh and one each from Syria, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan. The delegates are carrying with them, medicine, foodstuffs and toys, worth one million dollars. In Damascus, the Hamas leader in exile, Khaled Mashaal addressed the visiting activists on December 22. He paid his tributes to Mahatma Gandhi for his inspiring struggle against the colonialism. He hoped that one day, he would receive the delegates in liberated Gaza and finally in a liberated Palestine at Jerusalem. The visiting group also went to the giant Yarmuk refugee camp where over a lakh of displaced Palestinians reside. The organisers had hoped to land the relief material to Gaza, across Egypt through the Rafah crossing, on December 27, the day Israel launched a 22 war against Hamas in Gaza in 2008.  OPEN",

        "content": " Gujarat goes to the polls in the second and final phase on Monday in the backdrop of a huge turnout in the first round of polling, even as the Opposition Congress tried to make the most of the last day of campaigning on Saturday. Mondays voting in 95 constituencies would decide the fate of Chief Minister Narendra Modi, who is facing Shweta Bhatt, wife of suspended IPS official Sanjiv Bhatt, as well as that of several BJP and Congress bigwigs and Ministers. There are as many as 1.98 crore eligible voters. The polling will take place in central and north Gujarat, where as many as 820 candidates, including 95 from the BJP, 92 from the Congress and 84 from Keshubhai Patels Gujarat Parivartan Party, are in the fray. There are 49 women contestants. Analysts say Mr. Modi is seeking to recover the BJPs possible losses in Saurashtra and in tribal regions in South Gujarat by netting votes in central Gujarat. Several of the 52 seats in central Gujarat fall in the tribal region and are conventional Congress strongholds but Mr. Modi launched welfare schemes worth Rs. 14,000 crore in the tribal belt which stretches from Ambaji in the north touching Rajasthan and goes past Dahod on the Madhya Pradesh border up to Saputara, a kissing distance away from Maharashtra. The last day of campaign in central and north Gujarat as well as Kutch saw Mr. Modi and Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi sweating it out, while Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari and a host of others too joined the campaign. Mr. Modi raised the Sir Creek issue again and claimed that as he had predicted, a Pakistani delegation reached New Delhi on Saturday. He demanded that the Centre must clarify whether it would discuss the issue of Sir Creek with Pakistan. He said the Centre had no strength to counter Pakistan which was evident from the fact that a Minister from the neighbouring country Rehman Malik could dare equate the 26/11 Mumbai attacks with the Babri masjid demolition. at Ayodhya. Mr. Modi alleged that the Centre wanted to go ahead with its plan on Sir Creek behind the heat and dust of the Gujarat election. If you want you stop the election, you could do it, but I wont keep quiet when it comes to national interest, he said. Mr. Gandhi would not respond to any of it, but targeted Mr. Modi for his politics of anger and said it was time the people of the State switched to the power of love preached by Mahatma Gandhi. He reiterated without naming Mr. Modi that in Gujarat, Common peoples dreams are not looked at, it is just one man's dream that prevails and he is doing politics of anger. This one man claims to run Gujarat and having changed the entire State is full of anger, and with anger the State cannot progress ahead, he told a rally in Bhuj. It was love of the people that could help the State progress and not anger. Two out of four people who mattered the most to me in my life were snatched away by terrorists. When my grandmother and father died, I had a lot of angst in me... Your Chief Minister who talks about anger is wrong, you are full of love and there should be a government which has love.  OPEN",

Sub Inspector, Crime, Vanchiyoor police station, C. Mohanan identified the suspect as Vinod, a senior accountant at the Pension Payment Treasury at Uppalam Road. The government had sanctioned the saving banks accounts facility for the pensioners chiefly to benefit those who could not (because of age and illness) arrive every month at the pension treasury for availing themselves of retirement wages. The police said that Vinod mainly cheated pensioners who used cheques to draw pension from their savings accounts. The suspect altered cheque leaves submitted by the pensioners, by rewriting the amount mentioned, to draw extra money. The fraud came to light when a pensioner approached treasury authorities and complained that somebody had drawn extra money from his account without his sanction. An internal inquiry found that the complainant's cheque leaf had been deftly rewritten. The police studied the computerised pension disbursal system at the treasury and found that the manipulations had occurred in the computer placed at the teller counter manned by Vinod. The investigators shadowed Vinod and found that there had been an unexplained improvement in his lifestyle in the past two years. They found that he had purchased a new car, splurged money on lifestyle and was generally living beyond his means. The police confronted Vinod with the material and digital evidence they had gathered against him. Mr. Mohanan said Vinod subsequently confessed that he was responsible for the fraudulent manipulations in the savings bank accounts of over 16 pensioners.   OPEN",

        "content": " The police have launched a crackdown on illegal river sand-mining in the city. Last week, they arrested one of the alleged kingpins of the racket, Vella Rajan, under provisions of the Kerala Anti Social Activities (Prevention) Act (KAPA). Investigators said Rajan was accused in several cases registered last year under the provisions of the Kerala Protection of River Banks and Regulation of Removal of Sand Act. Investigators said the sand lobby in the city comprised a small group of politically influential businessmen who exploited the rich sand deposits of the Karamana river and the Vellayani freshwater lake to make killing profits at the expense of the State. With the help of certain gang leaders, they have contracted scores of local divers to excavate the Karamana river for sand from Idayar to Vattiyoorkavu. The mining operations are conducted under the cover of darkness. Miners drive long poles into the river bed, slither down them to the bottom to excavate sand, which is then loaded into country boats. About 10 country boat loads of sand make a truck load, which is auctioned on the bank for nearly Rs.60,000. The divers are paid Rs.700 for two hours of their work. Local gang leaders get Rs.100 for every truck load of sand transported from the river bank. The police said several gang leaders, including Soju, who was arrested last Sunday, charged illegal sand-miners more than Rs.3 lakh a month as protection money. Investigators said Soju, an accused in several other cases, had attacked the house of an illegal river sand-mining kingpin, Ramesh Kumar alias Koodam Maniyan, for refusing to pay Rs.5 lakh that he demanded. The sand lobby also employed gangsters to coerce citizens owning land abutting the Karamana river to sell them their land for mining operations. At several areas it was observed that the banks of the river have caved in, creating huge and unstable caverns along the riverside. The course of the river has been altered at several places and large placid pools have formed along its course where miners have deepened the river bed. The police have generated a detailed intelligence report on sand-mining operations in six police stations abutting the Karamana river. They found that several corrupt government enforcers helped the sand-mining lobby by passing on information about impending raids and allowed the lawbreakers to use bogus passes to transport illegally mined sand. The police said they would also book those who purchased and stocked illegally mined river sand. They would use flat bottomed speed boats and powered rubber dinghies to patrol the city's maze of inland waterways, lakes and rivers. They were also re-investigating several sand lorry seizures in the past year to detect who were the big time beneficiaries of the seemingly unstoppable racket.

The chilling details about the opening moments of the bloodbath in the bucolic community of Newtown came as investigators pressed for information about the gunman, Adam Lanza, 20. A police spokesman, Lt. J. Paul Vance, said investigators had produced some very good evidence, but he provided no explanation for a massacre that unfolded with chilling speed as Lanza opened fire in one classroom and then another, turning a place where children were supposed to be safe  an elementary school with a sign-out front that said Visitors Welcome  into a national symbol of heartbreak and horror. Lt. Vance said the victims bodies had been taken from the school, Sandy Hook Elementary. The one survivor, a woman who was shot and wounded at the school, would be instrumental in piecing together what had happened. He declined to describe the evidence that he said investigators, who continued to comb through the one-storey school on Saturday, had found. Officials said the killing spree began early on Friday at the house where Lanza had lived with his mother, Nancy Lanza. There, he shot her in the face, making her his first victim, the authorities said. Then, leaving her dead after taking three guns that apparently belonged to her, he climbed into her car for the short drive to the school. Two of the guns were semiautomatic pistols. Outfitted in combat gear, Lanza forced his way into the school, apparently defeating an intercom system that was supposed to keep people out during the day unless someone inside the school buzzed them in. This contradicted earlier reports that he had been recognised and allowed to enter. He was not voluntarily let into the school at all, Lt. Vance said. He forced his way in. President Barack Obama, meanwhile, used his weekly radio and Internet address to mourn the victims, saying every parent in America has a heart heavy with hurt. The Presidents address was similar to a statement he read in the White House press room on Friday, when he paused, more than once, and wiped his eyes. Our hearts are broken today, Mr. Obama said in his address. He mentioned other places where there had been mass shootings this year, including a mall in Oregon, a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and a movie theatre in Colorado, as well as countless street corners in places like Chicago and Philadelphia. 'Any of these neighbourhoods could be our own, Mr. Obama said. So we have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.

        "content": " The massacre of 26 children and adults at an elementary school in the U.S. State of Connecticut elicited horror and soul-searching around the world even as it raised questions about why the gunman, a 20-year-old described as brilliant but remote, would have been driven to such a crime and how he chose his victims, some as young as 5. Investigators were trying to learn more about the gunman, Adam Lanza, who, at least one witness said, didnt say a word as he burst into a classroom, shooting, and later killing himself. Police shed no light on the motive for the mass shooting, one of the deadliest in U.S. history, and among school attacks was second only to the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, which left 33 people dead. Reaction was swift and emotional around the world. President Barack Obamas comments on the tragedy were one of the most outwardly emotional moments of his presidency. The majority of those who died were children beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old, he told a White House news briefing. He paused for several seconds to keep his composure and wiped an eye. Nearby, two aides cried and held hands. In tight-knit Newtown, a picturesque New England community of 27,000 people, hundreds of people packed St. Rose of Lima church on Friday night and stood outside in a vigil for the 28 dead  20 children and six adults at the school, the gunmans mother at home, and the gunman himself. Just 10 days before Christmas-eve, people held hands, lit candles and sang Silent Night. These 20 children were just beautiful, beautiful children, Monsignor Robert Weiss said. These 20 children lit up this community better than all these Christmas lights we have ... There are a lot brighter stars up there tonight because of these kids. Lanza is believed to have suffered from a personality disorder and lived with his mother, said a law enforcement official who was briefed on the investigation. Lanza shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, drove to the school in her car and shot up two classrooms around 9.30 a.m. Friday, law enforcement officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A custodian ran through the halls, warning of a gunman, and someone switched on the intercom, perhaps saving many lives by letting them hear the chaos in the school office, a teacher said. The well-liked principal, Dawn Hochsprung, was believed to be among the dead. A woman who worked at the school was wounded.  AP  OPEN",

For, an informer who eavesdropped tipped off the police, which led to the arrest of K.V. Suneel Kumar who allegedly paid a Rs.1 lakh to his cousin and his friend to eliminate Manoj Kumar Kumble in June 2009. Kumble used to pull up Kumar over his performance and complain to the higher-ups in the MNC. Enraged by this, Kumar, the son of a police official, discussed the matter with his cousin H.G. Umesh, an attendant in a petrol station. The supari Umesh offered to kill Kumble for Rs.1 lakh. As agreed, Kumar paid him an advance of Rs.5,000. Umesh bought a knife at the K.R. Market. On June 30, 2009, Kumar took Umesh and his friend Chandra to Kumbles house in Madiwala. Kumble, who was watching TV with his friend Kiran, came out of the house. He was stabbed to death and the trio fled. Kumar resigned after few weeks when he was offered a government job on compassionate grounds when his father died in service. He joined as a First Division Assistant in the Revenue Department and got married. He was the father of a year-old child when the police came knocking on his door. Meanwhile, his accomplices Umesh and Chandra had started demanding more money and regular treats at bars now that Kumar had a government job. During one of such session, the inebriated trio bragged about the murder, patting their own backs over not getting caught. An informer, who was at the adjacent table, heard their conversation and tipped off the jurisdictional police inspector. But by the time the Madiwala police arrived, the three had left. However, the CCTV footage at the bar helped trace Umesh and Chandra who initially feigned ignorance but confessed under grilling.  OPEN",

It was sheer providence that a passerby pulled out the UKG student who had the presence of mind to cling to the edge with the rest of him immersed in slime and sewage. Poorly lit street Chandramouli K., son of software professional Suryanarayana Murthy and Lalitha, had gone out to play around 6.30 p.m. Speaking to The Hindu , the still-shaken mother said: He had gone cycling in the evening as usual. Later, his friend took the cycle and was riding it while Chandramouli [trotted] behind him. As it was dusk and the road ill lit, he did not see the manhole and fell right into it. It was filled with waste, most of it sanitary waste. She said she reckoned the manhole to be 10 feet deep. His screams brought a passerby to his help and the child came home shocked, crying and soaked. He was later taken to a hospital and brought back home. There are two streetlights near the manhole but on Monday evening both were not functioning. As it was dark, he said he could not spot the manhole and fell into it. Residents furious Livid residents of the area said the manhole had been left uncovered for more than a month despite many complaints. Angry over authorities apathy, they pointed out there are two schools here. The Chavara Church School is located just 10 feet away from the manhole and another kindergarten school, Kids Paradise, is also located nearby. Any child can fall in, a neighbour fumed. Ms. Lalitha said residents continuously tried calling local councillor Saroja Veerappa, but her phone was switched off. Right now the manhole is covered with an asbestos sheet, which is hardly the ideal solution, she said. Members of the All India Human Rights Organisation also gathered at the area and demanded that the manhole be closed permanently. This could happen to anybody tomorrow and the civic body must take necessary measures immediately, said Seethalakshmi, a member.  OPEN",

The police have traced four of them. On the night prior to their escape, all 16 orphan girls in the Balamandira went on the rampage, throwing and breaking furniture, and ransacking cupboards of clothes. Even an LPG cylinder in the kitchen was damaged. Their demand was that they be given the freedom and opportunity to go out of the premises of their hostel, just as others of their age group do. The girls refused to eat in protest on Thursday night, after which the angry and resentful group threw a collective tantrum. They allegedly manhandled the staff of the Balamandira, the warden included. When some local police officials visited the Balamandira on Friday, the girls pleaded that they be allowed to visit a temple to offer prayers. When attempts to pacify them failed, Chief Executive Officer of the zilla panchayat Rajendra Cholan and KGF Superintendent of Police (in charge) Ram Nivas Sepat rushed to the spot. They too had to face the wrath of the girls. Ten of the 16 children escaped even as a discussion was going on to resolve the situation.

Sources said here on Saturday that the district election authorities have recommended re-polling in two polling booths in Ankalga village and the State Election Commission is yet to take a final decision on this. According to information available here, trouble started in Ankalga village after a village accountant from another village was seen campaigning for a particular candidate. This led to a fracas between the village accountant and the supporters of another candidate. In the melee, the village accountant was beaten up and chased away. Later, a mob barged into the polling stations and damaged electronic voting machines in two polling booths and also other poll material. The police have rounded up a few persons in this connection. According to rough estimates, more than 55 per cent voters exercised their franchise in the elections to the zilla and taluk panchayats in the district. Counting of votes will be taken up on January 4. Polling which began on a dull note in the district picked up slowly. Brisk polling was reported in the afternoon. In polling booths in a few parts of Gulbarga, Aland and Afzalpur taluks, women showed enthusiasm in exercising their franchise. There were no incidents of violence or poll boycott in the district. The fate of 539 candidates fighting for 155 seats in the seven taluk panchayats in the district and 189 candidates vying for 43 zilla panchayat seats will be decided on Tuesday.

        "content": " The fate of Chairman and Managing Director of the public sector giant HMT Ltd, S.G. Sridhar, hangs in the balance while the Department of Heavy Industries (DHI) decides what action is to be taken against him, highly placed sources in the DHI told The Hindu . This follows an internal inquiry by the DHI earlier this year into the running of the HMT Ltds tractor manufacturing unit at Pinjore that uncovered a scam running into hundreds of crores of rupees in which sales, production and turnover figures were systematically fudged and over-reported in the annual reports and other official statements of account. The data falsification started in 2011. Mr. Sridhar was appointed CMD on 19.9.2011. In March, the Union government approved a Rs. 1,083-crore revival package for the public sector company, based on what appeared to be an improvement in performance. In particular, company reports, which showed a reduction in losses and an increase in output and sales, may have had a bearing on the decision. However, it now transpires that the figures were dressed up by the management to strengthen its case for the Centres grant, according to privileged sources in the DHI. In the April-December 2012 period, the plant utilised only 22 per cent of its capacity of producing 10,000 tractors per annum  its peak production was in 2000 when it manufactured 7,000 tractors  and was reeling under heavy cash losses. According to data put out by the Tractor Manufacturers Association, HMTs share of the Indian tractor market is just 0.5 per cent. The fudging involved concealing production backlogs and adjusting them in the following financial year. Thus, there was an over-reporting of 771 tractors produced in 2011-12 and of 596 tractors in 2012 (April-December). The data-fixing had a snowballing effect. The falsified production data resulted in the overbooking of tractors to distributors. And rather in the spirit of Chichikov, the protagonist of Gogols Dead Souls , who buys souls (serfs) who have died but whose names are still in property registers, the HMT management collected bookings for 1,416 non-existent tractors in the April 2011 to December 2012 period. According to DHI insiders, with the available working capital, the company is not even able to reach the break-even production level of 700 tractors a month. Headquartered in Bangalore, the 60-year-old HMT  for several decades the celebrated timekeeper of the nation, and a powerful home-grown manufacturer of capital goods  was severely hit by the new policy and business regime post-1991. In 2000, HMT was broken into five subsidiary companies, HMT Ltd. (which controls the Pinjore tractor plant), HMT Machine Tools, HMT Watches Ltd., HMT Chinar Ltd., HMT Bearings and HMT (International) Ltd. This was primarily done to give autonomy to the subsidiaries and to leverage the companys experience and skills through product diversification. Poor leadership and bad planning since then have taken the company further into the doldrums.

The injured were Ridhi Ladhani (20), Sanjana (20), Utsha (19), Shika (20), Heersha (20) and Sneha Sunil (20). The girls were 3rd year students of B.Sc electronic media at MOP Vaishnav College for Women in Nungambakkam. According to the traffic police, every Saturday, the girls would meet up at one of their houses and stay until quite late in the night. The group gathered at Ridhis house on Medavakkam Tank Road in Kellys on Saturday. Around 2 a.m. on Sunday, they decided to go for a drive in Ridhis car. They were going towards Mamallapuram at high speeds. When the car neared a bend near VGP Golden Beach in Injambakkam, Ridhi made a swift turn. The vehicle went out of control and flipped thrice before coming to a halt, said inspector A.J. Ravikumaran. Aakrithi who was in the front passenger seat, sustained severe head injuries and died on the spot, the officer said. The other girls, including Ridhi who was behind the wheel, sustained injuries and were admitted to a private hospital. They are now out of danger. The roof of the car, its windshields and right-side wheels were completely damaged in the accident. The vehicle was towed away to Shastri Nagar.

Mohankumar and his college mates to have a close look at the wildlife in Bhavanisagar forests, though many of them were natives of Sathyamangalam block. Silently motioning his friends to look at a herd of spotted deer resting under the shade of a tree near Thengu Marahada, Mohankumar took a seat on a rock without making a noise. I have never seen large number of deer at close quarters. I will remember this forever in my life, he said. The boys, all students of Kaamadhenu Arts and Science College, Sathyamangalam, were taking part in a drive launched by the Forest Department to remove the snares laid to trap animals in the Bhavanisagar forests range in Sathyamangalam division. Initially we are worried a lot about going into the forests. After we stepped into the jungle, we felt very close to the nature and our fears vanished, S. Anandkumar, another student, said. Anandkumar and 15 of his classmates searched for the snares along the Moyar river in Thengu Marahada. We understood why we should protect our forests. We deeply regret about the damage we have inadvertently caused to the environment, many students said after returning from the drive. The drive is also aimed to educating the students on the need to protect wildlife, said District Forest Officer N. Satheesh, who was the brain behind the idea of involving students in the drive. Eco Club A total of 57 students from the Eco Club of the college participated in the drive. The students were split into five groups and assigned separate areas to carry out the search. Senior Project Officer from WWF Peter Prem Chakravarthi, who led a group, said that the students observed a lot during the drive. They should be given more opportunities to witness the wildlife closer so that they will realise the need for wildlife conservation, he suggests. Mr. Satheesh says that the department has plans to carry out similar drives in forested areas with the involvement of students.  OPEN",

In a session highlighting the association between democracy and growth, Prof. Dipankar Gupta, former senior fellow at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, said democracy has done little to flatten differences in a diverse land such as India. Drawing a parallel between democracy and art, Prof. Gupta said both should aim at reshaping society rather than merely reflecting it. He said the Indian democracys approach to growth has been one of maximising the given which often ends up impeding the process itself. Extending his point further, he said identity continues to shape the outlook of groups pressing for sectional advantage and that universal, and not targeted development schemes, were the need of the hour. He said that although committees such as Sengupta and Tendulkar Committees have provided varied estimates on poor in the country, the absolute number of those under the poverty line is incontestably high. You can have a target-based approach for growth only where the poor are in a minority, else you are going to miss the targets you have set, he said referring to some of the figures cited in those reports. Contesting Prof. Guptas proposition, discussant Satish Deshpande from Delhi University said some identities such as caste are ground realities which one cannot wish away while formulating policies on growth. Prof. Deshpande said in art one might have the scope of starting from the scratch in the form of a clean canvas but in a democratic process . we are always in the middle of history and ..to abolish caste, one has to pass through caste and empower those who have lagged behind. Though the country made significant and rapid progress in the first few decades after independence but a large majority could not reap the benefits and that is where caste had to be invoked. Only the privileged class can claim to leave caste behind, he said, stressing that merit is the outcome of a social process and is not acquired magically. He added that in a country like India which has had a history of substantive inequality the playing field would continue to remain tilted for the disadvantaged sections in absence of measures such as reservations. Former Reserve Bank Governor Bimal Jalan, who chaired/moderated the discussion between Prof. Gupta and Prof. Deshpande, was critical of the current factitious nature of Indian polity and termed its compulsions as damaging for growth. Earlier in the day, Professor Joan Martinez-Alier from the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology, Barcelona, pointed out that with development a number of ecological conflicts such as illegal sand-mining from river beds have entered the Indian arena.

According to the police, the trouble started when Adi Dravidas from Mangalapuram Colony went to Vedal and erected banners in connection with the birth anniversary celebrations of B.R. Ambedkar. This was objected to by the caste Hindus of Vedal, who tore the banners. This led to a clash between the two groups leading to injuries to three persons  two from Mangalapuram Colony and one from Vedal. As news of the incident spread to nearby Paranji village, the local caste Hindus went to the Adi Dravida Colony in Gudalur and burnt two shops and pelted stones on the houses in the colony. Settu (50) belonging to the Adi Dravida Colony was injured in the incident. Vellore Collector P. Sankar, Superintendent of Police I. Eswaran and Deputy Superintendent of Police, Arakkonam, S.

Nevertheless, we will act on UGCs suggestions and review the measures taken so far for the safety of women on the Manasagangotri campus here, he said. Prof. Shivaraj claimed that the campus had been safe for students all these years and there has been no problem whatsoever. There are about 500 girls in one hostel and nearly 150 in the working womens hostel. Security guards keep watch over the premises, he said. A decision will be taken on the need to strengthen the security around the hostels. Girls hostels are closed after 7 p.m. Hostel residents have been advised not to leave the premises after that, as the buildings are located in a secluded place inside the campus and there is no direct transportation arrangement, he said. Guards Prof. Shivaraj said the university had deployed 25 guards inside the campus. The hostels are well protected with high walls, he said, adding that two guards have been deployed at each hostel. He said that a new committee had been constituted last year, to probe complaints of sexual harassment in the campus. Meanwhile, R. Indira, Director of the International Centre, University of Mysore, said that in spite of complaint mechanisms in India for cases of sexual harassment of women, many cases did not come out at all for various reasons. It is time that women are informed of their rights. An atmosphere should be created where women do not feel threatened after lodging complaints of sexual harassment.

He said the Supreme Court of India had in a judgment, popularly known as Vishakha case, laid down guidelines for all departments in the country to constitute committees for hearing the grievances of women. Women are entitled to avail themselves of 365 days of child care leave which includes leave for education of the child, under the new guidelines, he said. The committee took stock of the arrangements made by the State government and institutions such as the State Bank of Travancore, Coir Board and Cochin Port Trust. The Lok Sabha has already passed a Bill on the subject, he said. The parliamentary panel sought the opinion of the State government on compulsory registration of marriagesin the light of the Registration of Births and Deaths (Amendment) Bill, 2012, under which, Parliament proposes to make registration of marriages compulsory all over India. Registration of marriages was irrespective of the religion of the partners. A need to this effect was also expressed by the Supreme Court of India in Seema vs Ashwinikumarcase. Mr. Naik expressed happiness that the Government of Kerala had made rules to this effect and had made registration of marriages in the State compulsory. The committee heard the views of Principal Secretary S. Peter; Law Secretary Prem Pradhan; Secretary of Local Self-Government; Registrar; religious representatives from Hindu, Christian and Muslim communities; and a representative of the Kerala High Court Bar Association. The other members of the parliamentary delegation included Sukhendu Shekhar Roy, Jesudas Seelam, Parimal Nathwani, Arjun Ram Meghwal, S. Semmalai, S.D. Shariq, Meena Singh and Vijaya Bahadur Singh. 38 fast track courts in the State made permanentPanel discusses status of women employees 38 fast track courts in the State made permanent Panel discusses status of women employees  OPEN",

        "content": " In the backdrop of the recent mob frenzy in Dharmapuri district and attack on Dalits in Cuddalore district, a public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the Tamil Nadu Government to establish exclusive special courts under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Protection of Civil Rights Act in all atrocity-prone districts. The First Bench of Chief Justice M.Y. Eqbal and Justice T.S. Sivagnanam ordered notice to the authorities, returnable in four weeks. Petitioner A. Narayanan of Virugambakkam here, a social activist and Editor of Paadam, a Tamil magazine, stated that as per Section 14 of the SC and ST Act, the government should have established special courts in all the districts. However, such courts were functioning only in Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Tirunelveli and Madurai districts. Mr. Narayanan said that as per the 2011 census, 19 per cent of the people in the State belonged to SC and 1.04 per cent, ST. Tamil Nadu had the fifth largest Dalit population in the country. Though special courts are functioning in the four districts, various forms of atrocities were being reported from many other districts such as Dharmapuri, Villupuram, Cuddalore, Virudhunagar, Sivaganga, Coimbatore, Namakkal, Salem and Krishnagiri. As per the report of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, the list of Identified Areas or Atrocity-Prone Areas, designated by the Tamil Nadu Government, had 28 districts. In the absence of special courts, trial of cases will be hampered. Speedy justice will become elusive and subsequent rehabilitation of innocent victims delayed or denied, he said.  OPEN",

And for her relieved and overjoyed parents, the next destination is Tirupathi where they will fulfil a vow made while the search was on. Pooja was kidnapped when she was five days old. The child born to autorickshaw driver S. Ravi kumar and Kalaiarasi, of JJ Nagar in Korukkupet, was kidnapped by a woman on October 25 from the Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar (RSRM) hospital in Royapettah. The suspect, later identified as Yogeshwari (22) of Tondiarpet, was arrested by police at her house on November 16 and infant was rescued. However, Kalaiarasi was unsure if the child was hers as its features had changed considerably by then. As per procedure, police sought a DNA test to establish the identity. In between all this, the family members staged a road roko demanding swift action by police. For a while, it was suspected that an infant girl found abandoned in an EMU was Kalaiarasis child, but it was proved wrong. Our child, after being rescued from the woman in Tondiarpet, was sent to Bala Mandir childrens home in T. Nagar. The sad part is my wife and I could not spend much time with her as the result of the DNA test was pending, Ravi Kumar said. Ravi and Kalaiarasis prayers were answered on December 8 when the DNA test confirmed that the infant was the couples child. After all the formalities, the baby girl was handed over to her parents on Friday evening, 52 days after she went missing. Im overjoyed at getting her back, Kalaiarasi repeatedly said at the RSRM hospital on Saturday where she and Ravi had come to give a declaration that they had taken possession of the child. As she came back to us on a Friday, we offered prayers and named her Pooja. We had decided to make an offering of coins equal to the weight of the baby at Tirupathi. We will go there soon, he said.

        "content": " The Karnataka High Court on Friday directed the State government to maintain status quo on the nature of 347 acres of grasslands near Hessaraghatta lake at Kodihalli village in Doddaballapur taluk. The land has been identified for setting up Chitra Nagari, a film city and theme park on the lines of the Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. A Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice K. Sreedhar Rao and Justice B.V. Nagarathna passed the interim order while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by M/s Arkavathi-Kumudavathi Nadi Punaschetana Samithi. The samiti contended in its petition that Hessaraghatta lake was a main feed-lake of the Arkavati, any so, development on land in survey numbers 82, 83, 92, 94, 95, 98, 99, 97, 100 and 101 of Kodihalli would severely affect the biodiversity. Rare species Quoting studies conducted by experts in agricultural ornithology from the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, the petitioner pointed out that besides many rare plant varieties, several endangered species of birds, reptiles and mammals had also been sighted in and around these lands. Birds such as short-toed snake eagle, lesser florican and species of harrier, as well as the slender loris, were among the animals found there. The petitioner has sought a direction to the State government to declare these government-owned grasslands, which are classified as gomal land, as protected area for preserving endangered species, protecting groundwater level and maintaining inflow into the lake. Disposed While hearing a PIL petition initiated suo motu about the mysterious death of B.N. Bramarambhika, who was a fourth semester law student of Seshadripuram Law College, the Bench disposed of the petition after the investigation and post-mortem report filed by the Chickballapur Superintended of Police disclosed that it was case of suicide by hanging and not a case of honour killing as alleged by some of her classmates. The young woman died on May 20, 2012. The court had initiated the PIL petition based on a letter written by the students to a sitting judge of the High Court suspecting that Bramarambika, a resident of Chickballapur could have become a victim of honour killing. The police, who exhumed the body and subjected it to post-mortem upon the courts direction, ruled out that possibility.  OPEN",

        "content": " For a week now, D. Kavitha, a police officer with the B-3 Tondiarpet police station, has been busy chasing, not criminals, but water. Every day, before she leaves for work, she scouts the neighbourhood for working taps and fills up a few vessels which she then carries back to the police quarters on Thiruvottiyur Main Road in Tondiarpet. Kavitha is not the only one with water woes. For many of the residents in the police quarters, fetching in a few pots of water every morning for domestic use, has become a daily routine, ever since Chennai Metrowater stopped the supply of water through tanker lorries to their building. Metrowater took this step because of the police departments non-payment of mobile water charges amounting to Rs. 30 lakh over the course of a few years, to the water agency. This is the second time in less than two months that taps have gone dry in the quarters after Metrowater took similar action earlier. Its difficult to source water from the neighbourhood as most of the localities here face water shortage, said K. Indumathi, a resident in the quarters. Families protest On Friday, nearly 100 families from the quarters tried to block the Thiruvottiyur Main Road demanding regular water supply but were then pacified by senior police officers. After a request by a few police officers, Metrowater officials resumed water supply but told them to pay their dues immediately. The water problem is a regular one here. But we told Metrowater officials that dues would be paid soon as we will take this issue up with our higher-ups, said inspector R. Sivamani of B-3 Tondiarpet police station. Built a decade ago, the building houses 250 families, mainly those of head constables and assistant sub-inspectors. It needs around one lakh litres of water to meet its daily requirements. The building has water pipeline connections, but these were suspended a few years ago after complaints of pollution in the water supplied by Metrowater through the pipeline. Since then, water is supplied through tankers to sumps in the quarters. For this, Metrowater collects mobile charges for transportation. We charge Rs. 600 per trip and on an average, we do at least eight trips to the quarters daily. Each tanker has a capacity of 9,000 litres. The mobile charge is different from water tax, which is collected for water supplied through pipelines, said a Metrowater official. Metrowater officials said several reminders and warnings had been given to the police department to pay their water dues to the agency, but the police department kept asking for more time. Instead of relying on tanker lorries, Metrowater officials said the police department should re-install the water connections that had been suspended. The police department should re-apply for a water connection, which is the only permanent solution to their water woes, said a metrowater official.  OPEN",

        "content": " As the demands for womens safety become more forceful, a father who lost his 19-year-old son to ragging has drawn attention to the fact that ragging has a sexual connotation as well and that a significant number of ragged students were also sexual abused. There have been a significant number of cases where rape has been guised as ragging, said Rajendra Kachroo, whose son Aman lost his life after being mercilessly beaten up by his seniors while being ragged at a Medical College in Himachal Pradesh four years ago. Mr. Kachroo, who runs an anti-ragging helpline, feels let down by the governments half- hearted contribution to anti-ragging activities and says colleges have done little to connect with students. Recently, I received a call from a father who said his son had been sexually abused by his seniors at a college, but was so shaken up that he even refused to register a complaint. And this is not an isolated case. There are several such instances where girls and even boys are sexually abused, he told The Hindu . Despite Supreme Court guidelines and a national outcry against ragging that has claimed the lives of many and left a sizeable number physically and mentally affected, educational institutions and the government have been slipshod in tackling the menace, claimed Mr. Kachroo. There is insensitivity and disconnect on the part of the college authorities as far as students welfare is concerned. There is a Dean of Students Welfare in most institutions, but there is little involvement in the welfare of the students. A teachers role does not end with academics alone. A case in point is this recent case of ragging involving a student of the School of Planning and Architecture in Delhi, the college is on record, claiming they did not know what happened to their own student. Accusing colleges and institutions of not adhering to the laid down guidelines against ragging, Mr. Kachroo said there have been instances when his anti ragging helpline has had to send repeated reminders to the authorities to take action. As soon as the helpline receives a complaint we immediately connect with the college concerned and pass on the message, some colleges have been quick to take action, but there are many that dont do so, despite our repeated reminders. We can push only to a certain point, he said. Mr. Kachroo is not too happy with the way the helpline is run as well. He says limited funds from the government for the project have meant a limit on how much can be spent on running the call centre. Consequently, the call centre cannot employ those who are more suited for the job. There is a problem of quality; while we have sophisticated software and an adequate number of operators to take down and record the complaints, the operators are not entirely equipped for the job that requires sensitivity and seriousness. The call centre that has been in service for the past seven months has registered more than 350 calls this past year alone. Though the numbers have come down from the previous years, there are gaps in the way the campaign is run. Colleges and the University Grants Commission need to do more to popularise anti- ragging helpline [1800-180-5522] and to tackle the complaints. The rule says all colleges must report complaints of ragging within 24 hours to the police, unless they are minor problems, he pointed out. Mr. Kachroo is also intensifying efforts to get students to file affidavits as part of the anti-ragging prevention plan. As per the policy, students and their parents have to file an affidavit before the student is registered for the programme. The helpline has collected about 1.5 lakh signatures already, but are targeting a million by June next year. Urging colleges and the administration to act tough against ragging, Mr. Kachroo said: Ragging is a betrayal of trust. When parents leave their children in colleges and hostels, they do so with a sense of security that their child will be looked after. They are given to believe that the staff and the administration will be responsible for the childs welfare. But the trust of these parents is betrayed when their children are ragged.  OPEN",

Justice Chitra Venkataraman passed the order while disposing of a writ petition by V.S. Suresh, an advocate of George Town here. Trouble began two years ago for Mr. Suresh, who was using an Airtel connection, when he started receiving obscene messages without his consent. He objected but his request was not considered. He went to the service providers office and made a complaint. After this he started receiving more such messages and the service provider deducted money from his account. He complained to the police, but no action was taken. He moved the Chief Metropolitan Magistrates court, which directed the police to register his complaint. Following this, an FIR was registered against the service provider in January last year. The police took his mobile phone for investigation but failed to return it. His petition seeking a direction to authorities to return the instrument is pending. In February and May last year, he sent representations to the Chairman, TRAI and the Telecommunications Secretary to take action against the service provider. He did not receive a reply and no action was taken. Hence the present petition. Mr. Suresh stated that the authorities should have taken action and protected the interests of subscribers like him. Disposing of the petition, Ms. Justice Chitra Venkataraman said, Considering the nature of the complaint made, which is a matter of common agony for even those who may not be petitioners before this court, this court feels that it is time that the first respondent (TRAI) looks into the grievance of the petitioner and puts an end to the harassment sent through messages immediately. The court directed Mr. Suresh to give a copy of the representation to the service provider, which should look into his grievance and do the needful.

First, the inclusion of the Internet in the resolution, even though it is not a part of the binding text of the ITRs. Second, on Article 5B relating to unsolicited bulk electronic communication or spam which is seen as an open door into content regulation since spam is considered content. Third, lack of clarity on which agency or entities will be placed under the ITU regulations. And lastly, opposition to the fact that the ITU, an intergovernmental body, should not enter the Internet since it is better served through a transparent, bottom-up multi-stakeholder process. Review in India India said it supports the proposed ITRs and the Resolutions 1, 2, 4 and 5. We support the broad thrust of Resolution Plan 3 regarding an enabling environment for the greater growth of the Internet, particularly its recognition of the multi-stakeholder nature of the Internet and its wider social and economic impact within and across countries around the world. Buying time under direction from Mr. Sibal, India stated, We need to consider the wider ramifications of this Resolution before taking a decision on signing of the ITRs. We would therefore like to undertake necessary consultations at home before announcing our final decision. The need for a rethink arose after a call for a sudden vote led by Iran which took most countries by surprise since voting is seen as divisive at such fora.

As the postal threat reached the project site at a time when the first reactor is being prepared for commissioning before January-end, agencies involved in providing security cover to the upcoming nuclear park have been put on high alert. Additional security measures have been put in place at the Anu Vijay Township at Chettikulam, about 12 km from the project site where KKNPP employees and their families live. According to the Inspector of Police, Kudankulam, S. Rajapaul, a postcard, addressed to Chief of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project and posted at Mount Road, Chennai, on December 31, reached the project site on January 3. As the postcard carried threatening message, a case was registered based on the complaint preferred by the KKNPP administration. The message threatened KKNPP employees and their family members and asked them to leave the complex immediately and return to their native places. Without giving any name, the sender has introduced himself / herself as Makkal Nanban. Following the threat, we received a complaint from the KKNPP administration around Friday midnight and filed a first information report in this connection, said Mr. Rajapaul. Further investigations are on to ascertain the origin of the postcard. Meanwhile, anti-KKNPP Struggle Committee convener S.P.

Yes, they might have banners and yes, the numbers may have dwindled, but at least they are here, says Tarun, a working professional who has been actively taking part in the protests demanding justice for the 23-year-old gang rape victim. The whole area of protest on Saturday is just a small street that has been cordoned off near Jantar Mantar and there are several groups of people who are doing different things. A group of sanyasi women is conducting a havan in the victims memory; then there is another group that has lit a really big candle in her memory and encourages others to light smaller ones around it; yet another group is making speeches, distributing pamphlets and encouraging everyone else to speak. I have come here everyday and have met many people and seen a certain change. On New Years Eve, a long human chain was formed and I realised that these people will never see a woman in distress and walk away. That is the change that this whole movement has brought about, Tarun adds. His sentiments are echoed by Neha, another professional he met during the protests. I observed a man who came on the first day screaming for death penalty for the rapists. But now he just comes here and sits quietly participating in the protest, realising that his presence is enough to keep up the movement, she says. The pamphlets speak of the reforms that will help bring about accountability from the police and other reforms that could help in preventing crimes by instilling fear in the minds of sexual predators. Some others distribute information about the measures a woman should take to be safe at all times. Another group distributes information about technology that can help a woman in distress and the precautions she can take to keep someone informed of her whereabouts at all times. There are men, lots of men, really old men. You have to take to the streets, ensure that justice is delivered and only then go home, you cannot be passive anymore. Tomorrow it could be you you could be the unlucky one says a suited and wrinkled old man into a mike. You will have to think of something else, this Jantar Mantar sit-in does not seem to be working. These protests dont seem to be working people are protesting the police stand on the alert and then everyone goes home says another old man who walks with the help of a stick. There are some of the young who got tear-gassed and beaten with sticks. I was there with my whole group right from the start; I believe that any noise is good noise, whatever little is being done for the victims justice is only because there are some people out here on the streets, if nobody had taken to the streets, there would never have been this sort of response from the police, judiciary or the hospital, said college student Kritikka.

While details of the suggestions given to the committee were not immediately known, the party has been favouring imprisonment up to 30 years for rapists and setting up of fast-track courts as also redefining the juvenile act by reducing the age limit. Leaders like Renuka Chaudhary had sought chemical castration of rapists but the party has made it clear that no such suggestion has been made by party chief Sonia Gandhi.

The CAG report was tabled during the winter session of the Assembly held at the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Belgaum last month. The CERNA Foundation of Hyderabad conducted the study on the impact of iron ore mining in Sandur taluk on the request by the Samaj Parivarthana Samudaya, petitioner in the illegal mining case in the Supreme Court. Mr. Sagar Dhara, head of the foundation, in the report, said that air pollution affected crops, water and livestock. Iron ore dust has increased the risk of cancer in people, the report said, adding that the incidence of the respiratory diseases in Hospet and Sandur taluks showed an upward trend due to air pollution caused by mining activities. The report also said that there is an increase in the incidence of various diseases in livestock. The regulating agencies of the State and Union governments have failed in protecting the environment and people in Sandur, the Sagar Dhara Committee report added. CAG suggestion The CAG suggested that before granting mining leases the government should conduct a thorough study for the greater common good on the likely impact of mining on life, lifestyle and livelihood of the communities concerned. The CAG favoured designing a participatory approach by involving local population. According to the CAG report, the area under cultivation in Bellary went down from 4,79,188 hectares in 2005-06 to 4,36,067 hectares in 2009-10. Consequently the area of barren land increased at an alarming rate. Similarly information obtained from Water Resources Department revealed that the area under irrigation decreased from 2,324.80 hectares in 2001-02 to 2,192.51 hectares in 2010-11. The CAG report stated that the prosecution of 123 employees under the Child Labour Act in Hospet and Sandur circles involving 167 children is indicative of employment of children below 14 years of age in mines. Evidently promotion of child labour apart from being unlawful would affect the sustained development of society, the report observed. Criticising the Karnataka government for its failure in implementing the guidelines suggested by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in its report, the CAG observed that laxity resulted in mining not compatible with preservation of environment. Director of Mines and Geology did not monitor adherence to the condition by the lessee prescribed by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) and the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) The CAG recommended the government to take necessary measures for proper accounting of plantations raised by lessees and monitor their periodical survival status in coordination with the Department of Forests.

It will not be affected in any way by the creation of regional parties such as the Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP), said Deepak Jamkhandi, general secretary of the BJP Yuva Morchas State unit, here on Saturday. He was addressing a meeting of ward and booth-level workers of the morcha. The former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa had power and respect only because of his association with the BJP. Now, he is speaking as if our party means nothing to him, Mr. Jamkhandi said. He says that he single-handedly built the party in the State. Nothing can be farther from the truth. The party was built by the hard work of thousands of workers and sympathisers. Mr. Yeddyurappa should realise that even great leaders such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee or L.K. Advani dont claim that they alone were responsible for the partys growth, he said. Respect The people of the State have great respect for the BJP and its rule for the last four years. We have to focus on spreading awareness about the BJPs governance, Mr. Jamkhandi said. He urged members to hold meetings of like-minded people to discuss government policies and the partys ideology. Challenge Ashok Hokrane, vice-president of the morchas State unit, asked members of the morcha to take up the challenge of organising the party without worrying about those leaders who had resigned from the BJP. We are a cadre-based party, and our success depends on party workers. We should never forget that, he said. General secretary of the BJPs State unit Raghunath Malkapure said the KJP had not caused any great damage to the BJP in the district. Except for Subhash Kallur, the former district unit president, no senior leader has joined the party, he said.

Zabiuddin Ansari, who investigators allege was present in the LeTs control room in Karachi at the time of the attacks, was held by the Delhi Police on his arrival from Riyadh on Monday morning. In phone conversations intercepted during the attacks, first revealed by The Hindu in February 2010 and now posted on the newspapers website, an individual speaking with a marked Mumbai accent can be heard instructing the terrorists to make a list of demands to the media. The men at the control room also issued instructions to the attackers on decisions that included killing of hostages, using voice-over-internet-protocol communi cations. Ansari, informed sources said, was held by the Saudi authorities earlier this year while he was travelling on a Pakistani passport, identifying himself as Riasat Ali. In July 2011, New Delhi requested his extradition from Pakistan, as part of a group of more than 50 wanted fugitives. The arrest came after months of patient work by the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Saudi Arabias intelligence service, the Riasat al-Istikhbarat al-Amah. Much of the National Investigation Agencys firsthand insight into the 26/11 plot has so far relied on the testimony of Pakistani-American jihadist David Headley, who carried out the reconnaissance, which allowed the assault team to reach its targets precisely. He identified Sajid Mir, LeTs controller of transnational military operations, as one of the men who instructed the team. Mondays arrest, government sources said, came after months of painstaking diplomatic talks among the authorities in Riyadh, Washington and New Delhi. Indian dignitaries visiting Saudi Arabia in recent months lobbied the Saudi authorities for assistance in Ansaris case. IB Director Nehchal Sandhu is also thought to have directly worked with his Saudi counterpart, Prince Muqrin bin Abdul-Aziz, to push forward the investigations. A Washington-based Indian diplomat told The Hindu that the U.S. also used its influence to push forward the case, seeing enhanced India-Saudi Arabia relations as a key element in bringing greater distance into Indias relationship with Iran. In the last six months, a senior government official told The Hindu , Saudi Arabia has dramatically improved its cooperation on counter-terrorism issues with India.  OPEN",

The high commands opinion was expected in one or two days, he told presspersons. According to Mr. Malkapure, the partys State unit had recommended that action be taken against the 14 MLAs and seven MLCs who attended the convention. Four of these legislators have said that they were forced to attend. We expect similar reactions from five or six others. We have apprised the party high command of all these developments and are waiting for their reactions. However, despite all this, if some legislators stick to their stand of supporting the KJP, the party will initiate serious action against them, he said. The BJP leader said the KJP would not be a major issue in the Assembly elections, as it would not have the strength to shake the partys [BJPs] structure. In Bidar district for example, no other leader has quit the BJP, except Subhash Kallur, former district unit president, Mr. Malkapure said.

While the Left Parties said that the State government was shirking its responsibility of providing land to large industries in the State by making such comments, the Congress demanded that the State government come out with a detailed project report on the status of land bank. Whatever land is under land bank has been identified from vested and surplus land in the previous Left Front government. There are isolated patches under the bank which is not sufficient for large industries. Since the State government has refused to acquire land for industries, the talk of land bank is useless, Surya Kanta Mishra leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly told The Hindu . Dr. Mishra has said that the policy of allotting land to industries through land bank, which the government is claiming, has no credibility as it has failed to attract industry. What is her [Ms. Banerjee] plan on it [land bank], in which areas did the government find those land, what is the total acreage under the bank, whether the land possesses required infrastructure for new industries, nothing is clear to us, State Congress president Pradip Bhattacharya said. Mr. Bhattacharya said that a mere announcement of land bank was not sufficient to attract industry in the State. The land policy of the Trinamool Congress has left industry and even the people at the mercy of land mafia and land brokers, Dr. Mishra said.

The questions have emerged after all of the mass killings in recent decades  a Virginia college campus, a Colorado movie theatre, a Wisconsin temple  but they took on an added sting when the victims included children. The fact that the Newtown massacre, with 26 killed at the school, along with the gunman, was the second deadliest school shooting in the countrys history after the 32 people killed at Virginia Tech in 2007  once again made this process of examination urgent national business as details emerged from Sandy Hook Elementary School. This painful corner of modern U.S. history does offer some answers: Many of the mass killers had histories of mental illness, with warning signs missed by the people who knew them and their sometimes clear signs of psychological deterioration left unaddressed by the countrys mental health system. Debate on guns The shootings almost always renew the debate about access to guns, and spur examination of security practices and missed warning signals in what were damaged lives. Research on mass school killings shows that they are exceedingly rare. Amanda B. Nickerson, director of a centre that studies school violence and abuse prevention at the University at Buffalo, said studies made clear that U.S. schools were quite safe and that children were more likely to be killed outside of school. But, she said, events like the Sandy Hook killings trigger fundamental fears. When something like this happens, she said, everybody says its an epidemic, and thats just not true. Dylan Klebold (17), and Eric Harris (18), may have earned singular infamy with the killing of 12 other students and a teacher from Columbine High School, in Littleton, Colorado, in 1999, but there have been others who breached the safety of U.S. schoolhouses over the decades. In 1927, a school board official in Bath, Michigan, killed 44 people, including students and teachers, when he blew up the towns school. Even before Columbine in the late 1990s, school shootings seemed to be a national scourge, with killings in places like Jonesboro, Arkansas, and Springfield, Oregon. In 2006, a 32-year-old man shot 11 girls at an Amish school in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, killing five of them. Often in a haze of illness, the schoolhouse gunmen are usually aware of the taboo they are breaking by targeting children, said Dewey G. Cornell, a clinical psychologist at the University of Virginia and director of the Virginia Youth Violence Project. They know its a tremendous statement that shocks people, said Mr. Cornell , and that is a reflection of their tremendous pain and their drive to communicate that pain. After 14-year-old Michael Carneal opened fire on a prayer group at Heath High School in West Paducah, Kentucky, in 1997, it came out that he had made no secret of his plans. He told me, once or twice that he thought it would be cool to walk or run down the halls shooting people, a friend from the school band testified later. Five Heath students were wounded; three were killed. But some experts on school violence said on Friday that it was not so much the character of the relatively rare schoolhouse gunman as it was the public perception of the shooting that transformed them into national and even international events. Dunblane, Scotland, is remembered for the day in 1996 when a 43-year-old man stormed a gym class of five-and-six-year-olds, killing 16 children and a teacher. Warning signs Over the years there have been some indications of what warning signs to look for. The New York Times published an analysis in 2000 of what was known about 102 people who had committed 100 rampage killings at schools, job sites and public places like malls. Most had left a road map of red flags, plotting their attacks and accumulating weapons. In the 100 rampage killings reviewed, 54 of the killers had talked explicitly of when and where they would act, and against whom. In 34 of the cases, worried friends or family members had desperately sought help in advance, only to be rebuffed by the police, school officials or mental health workers. After the deaths in Sandy Hook on Friday, there was new talk of the need to be vigilant. But there has also been talk of the sober reality that it is hard to turn the ordinary places of life into fortresses. Dr. Irwin Redlener, who is the director of the National Centre for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University and has worked on school violence issues, said there were steps that could be taken to try to limit school violence, like limiting entry, developing an explicit disaster plan that includes strategies to lock down schools and pursuing close ties with the local police. Unfortunately, he said, random acts of severe violence like this are not possible to entirely prevent.  New York Times News Service  OPEN",

        "content": " Candidates made final appeals to Japanese voters on Saturday, a day before parliamentary elections that are likely to hand power back to the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP ruled Japan almost continuously since 1955 until it lost badly to the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in 2009. The DPJs inability to deliver on a string of promises and Prime Minister Yoshihiko Nodas push to double the sales tax have turned off voters, who appear to be turning back to the LDP. An LDP victory would give the nationalistic Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister from 2006 to 2007, the top job again and signal a shift to the right for Japan. The party calls for a more assertive foreign policy and revisions in Japans pacifist constitution that would strengthen its military posture. His hawkish views raise questions about how that might affect ties with rival China amid a territorial dispute over a cluster of tiny islands claimed by both countries. With Japans economy stuck in a two-decade slump, the Liberal Democrats also call for more public works spending and are generally more supportive of nuclear energy though most Japanese want it phased out following last years disaster at Fukushima Daiichi. Mr. Noda, meanwhile, has sought to cast the election as a choice between moving forward or going back to the old politics of the LDP. Surveys this past week showed about 40 per cent of people were undecided, reflecting a lack of voter enthusiasm for any party, as well as confusion over the emergence of several fledgling parties. The right-leaning, populist Restoration Party of Japan, led by ex-Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara and Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, is calling for a more assertive Japan, particularly in its dealings with China. The anti-nuclear Tomorrow Party, formed just two weeks ago, is led by Yukiko Kada, an environmental expert and the Governor of Shiga prefecture. Major Japanese newspapers are projecting that the LDP will win a majority of seats in the 480-seat lower chamber of Parliament, meaning it could rule alone or perhaps form a coalition with the closely allied Komeito, a party backed by a large Buddhist lay organisation.

The department has declared medicinal plant Garduda pathala (Hysnocarpus pentandra) as endangered. The trees declared as rare and endangered are Bhrunga or Lavanga (Cinnamomum macrocarpum); Sannale or Karimara (Diospyros candouena); Hunnaru huli (Garcinia indica); Kadu jajikai (Myristica dactytaides); Kadekolu muruga(Garcinia gummigeetta); Neeru hippemara (Madhuca Neifouia); Rampathre (Myristica malabarica); and Chunga (Symmplocos racemosa). Others are Gulamavu (Forsea macranta); Halugondsa (Mappia foetida); Holehonne (Colophyllum apetatum); Hebbalasu (Artocorpus hirsute); Karimara (Diospyros candollena) and Neeruchunga (Symplocos cochinchinunnis). S. Shanthappa, Conservator of Forests, Mangalore Circle, told The Hindu that pressure on the forestland in the circle is increasing.'' Black Panther, Barasingha and long-tiled black Macaque are the endangered animals in the circle, he said. According to the wildlife census conducted in December 2009, only two Barasingha were spotted in the circle, Mr. Shanthappa said added that the department conducted census once in four years. Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts and the Kudremukh National Park area came under the circle. Someshwar and Mookambika sanctuaries were also part of it, he said. He said that the circle had 2.7 lakh hectares of territorial forests and one lakh hectares of deemed forests. According to the census, the circle had two tigers, one hog deer, 13 langurs, 29 elephants, 58 leopards, 165 wild buffaloes, 38 chithal, seven barking deer, 45 hare, 10 guar and 126 bison. There were 29 spotted deer, 12 mouse deer, 10 wild dogs and 52 sambar. Including other animals, the census had listed 1,151 animals, he added. Dinesh Holla, an avid trekker in the Western Ghats, said  that the mafia cultivating ganja, owners of some coffee and rubber estates, granite quarries and some hydel projects had emerged as threats to rainforests in the Western Ghats. Rainforests in Banjarumale, Barimale, Ambattimale and Elimate in the Charmadi range were being encroached upon by owners of coffee estates. Rainforests in Venkatagiri, Metkal Betta, Kombramale and Ombattu Bette in Shiradi range too were being encroached upon. The proposed Gundia Power Project would destroy a large forest area in the Western Ghats, he alleged.  Pressure on Mangalore forest circle is increasing'  OPEN",

The judge said the petitioner could not establish that Mr. Deo was not an ST and dismissed the election petition. Order set aside A Division Bench comprising Justice Gopala Reddy and Justice Durga Prasad set aside the order of the single judge directing the State government to pay Rs. 1 crore as compensation to the owners of Ramakrishna theatre, Hyderabad, which was burnt down in 1991. The Bench was allowing a writ appeal filed by the State government. It may be recalled that after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, mobs burnt down the theatre complex. The owners filed the writ petition seeking compensation as the State had failed to protect them. A single judge had directed the State to pay Rs. 1 crore compensation. The Bench did not approve the reasoning of the single judge and allowed the writ appeal of the government. A Division Bench comprising Justice Goda Raghuram and P.V. Sanjay Kumar permitted one Krishna Priya to attend the written examination to be held for selection of District and Sessions Judges. The Bench was dealing with writ petition field by Krishna Priya who said her application was received by the authorities on September 4, whereas the last date was September 3.

The TRS chief asked the supporters of Telangana to go ahead with the agitation called by M. Kodandaram led joint action committee (JAC) from January 1 irrespective of the January 6 talks. Let us see what they talk, but at the same time we cannot relax our grip on the movement, he remarked. One TDP voice urged He expected the Telugu Desam to depute one leader from Telangana and another from coastal districts for talks to create confusion in the minds of people about its commitment to the cause. In this context, he asked the TDP legislators from Telangana to mount pressure on their president N. Chandrababu Naidu to present a single voice himself. Their commitment would be exposed if it did not happen. He asked the TDP leaders to learn lesson from the manner the Congress MPs got cases against students withdrawn by taking up a hunger strike. Denies media reports Mr. Rao appealed to youth not to get distressed over media reports aimed at misleading them in the coming days. The trend had already set in as one newspaper put out a story that he might collude with former Member of Parliament Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy. Such a situation was unimaginable for him. 0I have seen that boy only once when he came to my house to extend an invitation for a function, he said. The meeting was also addressed by former Union Minister Ch. Vidyasagar Rao, Mr. Kodandaram and other leaders.   OPEN",

Jasbir Singh, a vendor, was on his way home after a day's work pulling along a cart laden with eggs when it got stuck in a pot hole just outside his house and a carton fell into a drain. The vendor's 32-year-old mentally-challenged neighbour standing outside his house could not help laughing at the sight. The man was sipping an aerated drink and offered it to the vendor which further irritated him. Enraged by his behaviour, Jasbir allegedly picked up a brick lying nearby and repeatedly hit the man on the head. The vendor's wife Charanjeet (38) also came out on hearing the screams and joined her husband in beating up the man. The man's father intervened and called up the Police Control Room. The police van reached the spot and took the man to hospital where he was declared brought dead. The couple was later arrested on charges of culpable homicide. Jasbir is a short-tempered man and is previously involved in four criminal cases, the police said. It is the third such incident in the past few days when a murder was committed over a trivial issue. On December 26, Aslam, a jhuggi-jhonpri resident in Naraina, was bludgeoned to death allegedly by a group of auto-rickshaw drivers for playing loud music on his mobile phone. In a similar case, Himanshu (36), a computer operator, was shot dead over the weekend when he accidentally hit a passer-by with his car's door while alighting. As per Delhi Police statistics, 15 per cent of the murders reported in the Capital in 2009 were committed due to sudden provocation.

Aiyappa, the Lokayukta police arrested him on Wednesday along with three other officials on charges of forging records of 32 acres and 27 guntas of government land at Madappanahalli, near the Bengaluru International Airport. The three other officials are K. Gopalaswamy, special tahsildar, Bangalore North taluk; N. Balakrishnamurthy, revenue inspector, Arakere Circle; and K.V. Ravikumar, sub-registrar of Hesaraghatta, here. All four were produced before the Special Lokayukta Court that placed them in the custody of the Lokayukta police for 24 hours, ending Thursday evening. Sources in the Lokayukta police said Mr. Aiyappa was arrested after he refused to cooperate in the investigation. Asked to appear for enquiry, he had the audacity to say that he would be busy till the end of the year and can come to our office only after that, said a senior Lokayukta police official. Private complaint  The case against Mr. Aiyappa was filed before the Special Lokayukta Court in the form of a private complaint by P. Anil Kumar. The court asked the Lokayukta police to file an FIR and investigate the matter, on November 5, 2012. The Lokayukta found truth in Mr. Anil Kumars allegation, and investigation showed that Mr. Aiyappa misused his official position to fabricate revenue documents and transfer the land in the name of Narasimhaiah, an 85-year-old Dalit labourer. Interestingly, the investigation found that Mr. Narasimhaiah was only a front for powerful people, including BJP MLA for Yelahanka S.R. Vishwanath. Lokayukta police officers said that Mr. Narasimhaiah was a poor man who did not know anything about the scam. He was asked to come to the Deputy Commissioners office and made to sign some documents for which he was paid Rs. 1 lakh, said an officer. The worth of the property is estimated to be at least Rs. 60 crore. The gains from the trade in this land were to be shared by the other accused. What, however, catches the eye is the impunity with which this illegal act was committed. Mr. Aiyappa withdrew his order conferring the titles of the land [in favour of Mr. Narasimhaiah] four times when he got information that local residents were planning to approach the courts and expose the fraud. When the threat of expose died down he again passed the same order, said an official.

Tyagi, and his three cousins, besides nine others and six companies, have been named by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the case it registered in the VVIP chopper scam. The agency suspects the retired Air Chief Marshal had approved certain changes in the tender specifications that opened the doors for the Italian firm AgustaWestland to bid for the contract. A fortnight after the agency instituted a Preliminary Enquiry into the matter, it registered a case of alleged corruption, conspiracy and cheating against the 13 accused persons, six companies and their unknown accomplices under various provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code. The CBI has alleged that AgustaWestland paid bribes through middlemen to influence public servants in order to swing the deal  for supply of 12 VVIP helicopters  in its favour. The CBI has alleged that during his tenure, the former IAF chief approved the reduction of the service ceiling of VVIP helicopters from 6,000 metres to 4,500 metres, a move that was previously opposed consistently by the IAF citing security related issues. AgustaWestland, which could not have qualified for the tender, was allowed to bid because of the relaxation made in the specifications, said a source in the agency. The agency on Wednesday conducted searches in Delhi, Gurgaon, Chandigarh and Mohali at the residences of Mr. Tyagi and the other accused persons and companies. Among those named in the case are the retired IAF chiefs cousins Julie, Docsa and Sandeep Tyagi; Chief Executive Officer of Aeromatrix Info Solution Private Limited Praveen Bakshi; IDS Infotech Chairman Satish Bagrodia and its Managing Director Pratap K. Aggarwal; and advocate Gautam Khaitan. Giuseppe Orsi, the then CEO of AgustaWestlands parent company Finmeccanica; and Bruno Spagnolini, the then CEO of United Kingdom-based AgustaWestland, have also been named along with alleged middlemen Guido Ralph Haschke, Carlo Valentino Ferdinando Gerosa and Christian Michel. The companies named in the case are Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland, IDS (Tunisia), Infotech Design System (Mauritius), IDS Infotech (Mohali) and Aeromatrix (Chandigarh). It is alleged that in the procurement process of the helicopters, some persons acted as middlemen and allegedly influenced the deal in favour of the U. K-based company. It is also alleged that the Italy-based company paid commissions running into several million Euros to the middlemen who from their share allegedly paid huge sums of money to some Indian nationals under the garb of engineering contracts with the two India-based companies, said a CBI official. According to the sources in the CBI, investigations so far have revealed that Mr. Michel was allegedly paid 30 million Euros by the supplier company for the job and a part of that money is suspected to have made its way to India. The agency has also come across evidence to suggest that 24 million Euros were allegedly paid separately to Mr. Haschke and Mr. Gerosa.  OPEN",

Ravichandran (42), lodged in prison since 1992, to go on ordinary leave to resolve a property dispute among his family members, the Madras High Court has restrained him from giving interviews to the media, interacting with members of banned outfits and making adverse comments in connection with the case during his stay at his mothers house in Virudhunagar district. A Division Bench of Justice K.N. Basha and Justice P. Devadass passed the order while disposing of a writ appeal filed by the State Government challenging an order passed by Justice V. Ramasubramanian. Not finding any infirmity with the order passed by the single judge, the Division Bench made it clear that the expenses incurred towards providing escorts to the convict, the transportation charges as well as other incidental expenses during his leave period must be borne by the State. The escorts would be fully responsible for the safety and security of the convict during this period, it added. The orders were passed despite vehement objections raised by Additional Government Pleader T.S. Mohammed Mohideen who claimed that granting leave to the convict might prove prejudicial to public peace and tranquillity. Pointing out that the convict had already been granted five days of leave in September 2001 and six days in August 2002 to attend to the health needs of his then ailing father apart from three more days in May 2003 to participate in his fathers funeral, Mr. Mohideen said there was no need for the prisoner to go on leave to settle property disputes as arrangements for that could be made inside the prison itself. However, convicts counsel T. Lajapathi Roy said the single judge had considered all these objections in his order wherein it was stated that the incidents pointed out by the respondents do not convince me to hold that his presence was a threat  The prisoner has spent more than 20 years in prison. He has gone out only on three occasions for short spells. On all those three occasions, his conduct and character in society has not come to adverse notice.  OPEN",

        "content": " Moral turpitude means anything done contrary to honesty, modesty and good morals. The expression should be understood in the light of prevailing norms that is expected from a person. It should be interpreted in the widest possible manner while considering the conduct of a person convicted and sentenced, the Madras High Court has said citing the Supreme Court. The question before a Division Bench comprising Justices D. Murugesan and B. Rajendran was: Whether the conviction and sentence imposed on a bank employee under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (Dishonour of cheque) could be considered to be the conviction and sentence for an offence involving moral turpitude, thereby disentitling him from continuing as a union member and holding the post of its general secretary. M. Lakshmanan, who was the general secretary of the ICICI Bank Employees Union, Chennai, was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000 by the Judicial Magistrate, Alandur, in March this year. The Magistrate found that Mr. Lakshmanan, being a bank employee and knowing the law, had issued cheques to three individuals without maintaining sufficient balance. He had borrowed Rs.10 lakh each from three individuals. The bank union secretary filed a civil suit before the court. It alleged that as the appellant's services had been terminated, he could not be a union member. It also filed applications praying among other things for an interim injunction restraining the appellant from functioning as the union general secretary. A single Judge allowed the applications. Hence, the present appeals. In its judgment dismissing the appeals, the Bench said the appellant had been convicted and sentenced. It did not accept the argument that the criminal court's judgment had been questioned by Mr. Lakshmanan and the sentence had been suspended and thereafter the judgment could not be relied. It said pending appeal alone, the sentence had been suspended and not the conviction. So long as the conviction remained, the judgment could be the basis for granting injunction. That apart, the single Judge had granted the injunction not only on the basis of mere conviction, but also considering other factors. As far as the claim for disqualification of the appellant from being a union member and consequently its general secretary, the Bench said the union had made out a prima facie case and for that reason alone, the single Judge had granted the interim order. That apart it was the bank's specific case that in view of the conviction, the appellant had been dismissed applying the relevant provisions of the Banking Regulation Act. On the given facts of the case, the Bench said it did not find the single Judge's reasoning as arbitrary. It made it clear that whatever the findings rendered in its order would be only for disposal of the appeals. The interim applications and the findings could not be construed as conclusive restricting the right of the parties to canvass their stand in the pending civil suit.  OPEN",

Footage obtained from the closed circuit television system at the showroom helped the police identify the accused and apprehend them. The team recovered the stolen vehicle besides seizing a car said to be used by the accused and a two-wheeler. The names of the arrested were given as Jai alias Jaikumar, Chandru, Bharathi, Karikalan, and Senthil. The police sources said Jaikumar against whom several grave cases had been booked earlier, along with Chandru, Bharathi, and Karikalan came to the showroom a few days ago under the guise of purchasing a new car. Senthil followed them on a two-wheeler. The showroom representative displayed a latest vehicle leaving the key inside another car shown to them earlier. Chandru quietly drove the car and sped away. Meanwhile, the other four reportedly told the representative that they would get back to him later. The showroom authorities came to know of the car theft only later while drawing up the stock particulars. They approached the police with the CCTV footage on Saturday night which enabled the team in identifying Jaikumar.

Polling was also peaceful in all hypersensitive polling stations in the district. Polling began on a dull note as the cold weather forced voters to stay indoors. Voting picked up as the day progressed. Only five to six per cent of voting was recorded at all polling booths in Devar Hipparagi Assembly constituency. In Masibinal village of Basavan Bagewadi taluk, the voters complained that their names were deliberately removed from the list. There was a verbal clash between the tahsildar and Babaleshwar MLA M.B. Patil over the removal of names of 210 voters from the list. It was also alleged that the presiding officer and the revenue officials together removed the names of these voters as they belonged to Kuruba community and the Congress candidate contesting from the constituency is also from the same community. Irked by the alleged negligent attitude of the officers, Mr. Patil filed a complaint with the Election Commission against the revenue officials involved in election process. Polling at Bastihal villages of Bableshwar Assembly constituency was delayed for three hours owing to a technical snag in the electronic voting machines (EVM).

What is an ECG? questions that patients with heart disease or those with risks of heart disease may have in mind but forget on the way to the consultation room. Putting himself in the shoes of patients, city-based cardiologist N.Senthil Kumar has sought to provide answers to prevention, coping and aftermath of heart disease in his book How to protect your heart?: 150 must know questions about the heart for everyone. The first copy of the book was released by President Pranab Mukherjee at his residence in New Delhi recently. On what prompted him to write the book, the chief consultant at Kauvery Hospitals says, In the limited time spent in the consultation room, neither the patient can clear all his doubts nor the doctor give complete guidance. There may be many questions that a patient wants to ask but may not be able to. That which sets the book apart from various books on heart health is the question-answer format, says Dr.Senthil Kumar. The book has been divided into sections with questions that provide the reader a ready answer to what he is looking for. Starting with an introductory chapter that describes the structure of the heart, Dr.Senthil Kumar proceeds to talk about heart attack and risk factors. Diet and exercise play an important role in prevention and recurrence of heart failure is acknowledged by separate sections addressing both topics. The author also gives a fleeting insight into heart attack and its links with smoking, alcohol, obesity, workplace stress. Good and bad cholesterol have been discussed in length through questions under usage of cooking oils and consumption of nuts. In keeping with this years World Heart Day theme, women and heart disease is emphasised. Refusing to accept a heart problem is an impediment to treatment. Recognising chest pain and angina are important to save the heart, believes the cardiologist. The book talks about living with bypass, stent and artificial valves. It delve deeper into well-known terms by answering the whats and whys behind oft-heard tests including ECG, echo, treadmill test and angiogram. Travel tips for heart patients are an interesting bonus.  Book seeks to provide answers to prevention, coping and aftermath of heart disease  OPEN",

And for her relieved and overjoyed parents, the next destination is Tirupathi where they will fulfil a vow made while the search was on. Pooja was kidnapped when she was five days old. The child born to autorickshaw driver S. Ravi kumar and Kalaiarasi, of JJ Nagar in Korukkupet, was kidnapped by a woman on October 25 from the Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar (RSRM) hospital in Royapettah. The suspect, later identified as Yogeshwari (22) of Tondiarpet, was arrested by police at her house on November 16 and infant was rescued. However, Kalaiarasi was unsure if the child was hers as its features had changed considerably by then. As per procedure, police sought a DNA test to establish the identity. In between all this, the family members staged a road roko demanding swift action by police. For a while, it was suspected that an infant girl found abandoned in an EMU was Kalaiarasis child, but it was proved wrong. Our child, after being rescued from the woman in Tondiarpet, was sent to Bala Mandir childrens home in T. Nagar. The sad part is my wife and I could not spend much time with her as the result of the DNA test was pending, Ravi Kumar said. Ravi and Kalaiarasis prayers were answered on December 8 when the DNA test confirmed that the infant was the couples child. After all the formalities, the baby girl was handed over to her parents on Friday evening, 52 days after she went missing. Im overjoyed at getting her back, Kalaiarasi repeatedly said at the RSRM hospital on Saturday where she and Ravi had come to give a declaration that they had taken possession of the child. As she came back to us on a Friday, we offered prayers and named her Pooja. We had decided to make an offering of coins equal to the weight of the baby at Tirupathi. We will go there soon, he said.

Early on Sunday, Mohan created a scene over the issue. He was drunk. When Savithri chided him and asked him to return to his portion of the house, he got angry. He grabbed an iron rod that was lying around and attacked her. He also beat her maid, Vanitha (42), an investigating officer said. Hearing Savithris cries, her sister Vasantha rushed in, but was hit on the head by Mohan. Vasantha sustained severe injuries and bled to death. Alarmed neighbours rushed Savithri and Vanitha to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. Their condition is stable, the police said.

His wife too died after suffering severe injuries trying to save him. The police said, Arun Kumar (25) and Sathya (19), who got married three months ago, lived in a one-bedroom house on Nehru Street in Avvai Nagar of Choolaimedu. Around 10.30 p.m. on Saturday, the couple had a heated argument over some family issues. An upset Kumar doused himself with kerosene and threatened to commit suicide. His wife Sathya begged him not to, but he struck a match anyway. He held the lit matchstick at arms length not intending to set himself afire. However, a spark ignited and he was engulfed in flames. Sathya tried to save him but ended up getting severely burnt. Hearing the commotion, the couples landlord, Harikrishnan, who resides on the ground floor rushed in and took the injured couple to Government Kilpauk Hospital. Kumar died around 7 a.m. on Sunday and later, around 10.30 a.m., Sathya, too, succumbed to her burns. Kumar worked in a private firm and Sathya was a first-year student in a private engineering college on Rajiv Gandhi Salai. Three months ago, the couple married without the consent of their parents at Vadapalani Murugan temple and were living in a house in Ashok Nagar. Two months ago, they rented the Choolaimedu house. The couple were arguing over the lack of cooperation from their families. Kumar doused himself with kerosene and struck the match not realising the damage it would cause, said an officer who recorded Kumars statement before his death.  OPEN",

Police said the murder was the fallout of personal enmity, as the victim was allegedly responsible for the murder of a relative of one of his assailants a few years ago. R. Raghu, who was living in Nagapattinam district, had come to Patel Nagar on Sunday morning. Around noon, as he was walking on Patel Nagar First Street, two men followed him and hacked at him with their knives, and left him bleeding to death. Raghu first fell on a car, was pulled of it by the men and thrown to the ground, where they assaulted him further. Police took his body to the Tambaram Taluk Government Hospital for a post-mortem examination, and are investigating. Police said Raghu was the prime accused in the murder of Sivalingam in 2009. Sivalingams supporters launched a manhunt for him, but as they could not locate him, burnt down his house on Erikkarai Street. Since then, Raghu had been living in Nagapattinam district. Officials said it was still not known why Raghu arrived in Tambaram. Police added his assailants were suspected to be John and Manikandan, the latter being Sivalingams nephew. The murder, having taken place in broad daylight in a residential area, sent shockwaves throughout the locality.  OPEN",

Last night [on Monday night] he had posted on Facebook about the Durga Nagpal case and how it would backfire on the State, Mr. Moggalan said. Mr. Bharti has been charged under Sections 153/295 A of the IPC, which deal with provocation with intent to cause riot and deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. Mr. Moggalan, however, believes the arrest could be motivated by the fact that his father is known for his critical stance against the SP and SP MLA from Rampur, Azam Khan, through his writings. In his Facebook status, posted at 9.57 p.m. on Monday, Mr. Bharti said the Akhilesh Yadav government had totally failed on the recent UPPSC reservation and the Durga Shakti Nagpal issues. Senior SP leaders Akhilesh Yadav, Mulayam Singh, Shivpal Singh Yadav and Azam Khan were blind to the fact that the public did not consider them fit for democracy, he added. How they had been cut off from the public, the morale of criminals was high and unrestrained ministers had turned into monsters, they are penning down their own downfall.

Sounding an alert regarding such espionage attempts from across the border, the Intelligence Bureau has warned that Pakistans intelligence operatives (PIOs) were targeting defence forces headquarters and other strategic organisations to collect sensitive information. PIOs are frequently targeting government personnel/officers to collect sensitive information through spoofed VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calls prefixed with the STD code of DelhiThe PIOs have been using the stratagem of calling phone numbers of security forces posing as officers belonging to Army/Navy/Air Force HQ (headquarters) and collecting details about the deployment, movement and other information about security forces, says an internal note of the IB. The ISI operatives are also targeting Indian Railways, banks, and serving/retired employees and civil contractors working for Military Engineering Services (MES) to collect sensitive and defence-related information. They (PIOs) have also been making telephone calls under assumed identities by using spoofed numbers to various CPMFs (central paramilitary forces), railways, banks etc, the note says. They (PIOs) have succeeded in ferreting out sensitive information from the persons attending these calls. IB has been regular in highlighting the stratagem of PIOs using fake identities, the note adds. The IB has now asked the Department of Telecom to constitute a high-level technical committee to examine the issue of spoofed calls and find possible solutions that could be implemented in a time-bound manner. Explaining how the ISI has managed to infiltrate Indias communication networks, the IB note adds: Using VoIP and computer software to mask the point of origin of their calls, Pakistans intelligence operatives have been noticed to be masquerading as senior Indian armed forces officers to contact their targets on the telephone to collect such information. The modus operandi involves the use of software by PIOs operating from Pakistan to ensure that the mobile phone of the target displays the incoming call to be originating from a spoofed Indian number.

Awinash Kumar Dev, General Manager (Human Resources), died when portions of the factory were set on fire after a worker was allegedly subjected to caste abuse and suspended by a supervisor. Mr. Devs charred body was identified by his brother, the police said. Director-General of Police (Haryana) R.S. Dalal, accompanied by senior police officers, visited the plant on Thursday to take stock of the situation. He promised strict action against the culprits. Senior police officers, including Assistant Commissioner of Police (South) Ravinder Tomar and Inspector Om Prakash, were injured when they tried to whisk away the injured to hospital. Trouble broke out on Wednesday morning when a worker, Jiya Lal, was suspended for allegedly slapping a supervisor on the shop floor. The workers resorted to violence and set ablaze portions of the plant late in the evening after the management proposed to defer the reinstatement of the suspended worker till Thursday evening. Maruti Suzuki Workers Union president Ram Meher in a statement issued on Thursday said the supervisor abused and made casteist remarks against a Dalit worker, which was legitimately protested by fellow workers. While talks were on with union leaders, the management allowed its bouncers to attack workers. The gates were closed on the behest of the management and workers were attacked with sharp weapons and arms, he said. Though the company initially said at least 40 managers and executives were hurt, it later turned out that more than 100 were injured. More than a hundred of our executives and managers were injured in the attack and taken to hospital. Around 50 of them were discharged after first-aid and the remaining are still under treatment. Eight of them, including two Japanese, are in the intensive care units of different hospitals. The injured have sustained mostly head injuries and orthopaedic injuries, a Maruti Suzuki India Limited spokesperson said. We were caught unawares. Suddenly a mob, armed with iron rods and sticks, barged into our room adjoining the conference hall and started beating us black and blue. Some of our colleagues even jumped from some height to reach to the ground floor and escape. It was only after the police reached the spot we could be saved, said a senior Maruti Suzuki official at Artemis Hospital.  OPEN",

Addressing a media conference here, samakhya president Maganti Sitarama Swamy and general secretary M.V.S. Nagi Reddy said the verdict reportedly went against the irrigation interests of the State. The permission for increase of Almatti dam from 519.6 metres to 524.256 metres across the Krishna in Karnataka, doubling its impounding capacity, would turn the Krishna delta and the Nagarjuna Sagar ayacut into a desert, they warned. Fixation of dependable yield in the river at 65 per cent as against 75 per cent during the KWDT-I would result in a drop in water flows into the Nagarjuna Sagar ayacut and the Krishna delta. Mr. Nagi Reddy said. The State would not benefit anyway from the KWDT-II award which although allocated 1001 TMC of water for the former which was 200 TMCs more when compared to the previous award, Mr. Sitarama Swamy said. The tribunal's award vis-a-vis increase in the height of the Almatti dam would only benefit the farmers under the dam ayacut in Karnakata to a greater extent while leaving their lower riparian counterparts high and dry. The farmers in the Krishna delta and the Nagarjuna Sagar ayacut would miss the transplantation seasons when they receive the floodwaters from the Almatti dam, Mr. Swamy commented. The samakhya leaders called upon all political parties to shed their differences and rise to the occasion in defence of the irrigation interests of the State and save the ayacuts in the Krishna river basin within the State from turning into a desert. They said that the State would not have received the raw deal from the tribunal had the State government had made a strong case before the tribunal by paying heed to the pleas of peasant organizations and irrigation experts.

Talking to reporters after Chief Minister Jayalalithaa flagged off two Duronto Expresses to Madurai and Thiruvananthapuram from the Chennai Central, Mr. Mital said that accidents were reported from unmanned level crossings despite precautionary measures. People often fail to guess the speed of the approaching train. Accidents at level crossings are very unfortunate  deaths are caused due to complete carelessness. Eliminating unmanned level crossings was one of the priority areas for the Railways and the work was being monitored at the highest level. Of the total 2,800 level crossings in the zone, 1,800 were manned. We want to close down the unmanned level crossings by constructing RUBs or ROBs to facilitate the flow of vehicles. Where it is not feasible to construct them, the unmanned level crossings will be converted to manned level crossings. Mr. Mital said that the non-stop, high-speed Duronto trains would reach their destinations (Madurai and Thiruvananthapuram) much faster than conventional trains. Considering the timing of the operation, it was decided to provide food on the Chennai Central-Thiruvananthapuram-Chennai Central Duronto Express. The cost would be included in the fare. Since several trains from different parts of the country terminated at Chennai Central, there was a demand to provide connectivity to Madurai. There are many trains bound for Madurai and southern destinations from Chennai Egmore. The Chennai Central-Madurai Duronto Express, operated via Erode, Karur and Dindigul, will reach the destination in 8 hours. These trains will fulfil the expectations of the travelling public, particularly tourists, business people and students. Fare structure According to railway sources, the cost of travel in First Class AC in the Chennai Central-Madurai-Chennai Central Duronto Express will be Rs. 1,995 and Rs. 1,105 and Rs. 690 in Two-Tier AC and Three-Tier AC respectively.

Inaugurating a programme on protection of women and girl children from sexual harassment and on the techniques of self defence organised by District Legal Services Authority at Kundavai Nachiyar Government College for Women, Mr. Saravanan said girls should make use of free legal aid. They should spread the message to all women and approach courts for justice in case of crimes. Students appealed to the Judge to recommend to the government to start moral lessons in the school syllabus. Moral science is not taught nowadays in schools. It should be included in the curriculum, they said. The Judge assured to pass on their suggestion to government. When students said there is delay in rendering justice in our country by courts, the Judge said the number of courts is not proportionate to the increasing population of the country. The government has now taken steps to increase the number of courts and is in the process of setting up fast track courts. This will solve the problem. But at the same time justice should not be hurried without proper arguments and hearing both sides. J.Shankar, Deputy Superintendent of police, said apart from teachers and police, parents should also play a role in protecting girls and women. Girls should also be truthful and transparent to parents. T.

When the victims dies, the crime will attract death penalty or life imprisonment. The Central government is considering stringent laws to deal with sexual offences against women. P.

Over six cotton bags were damaged in the incident. Timely intervention of farmers and staff of the market yard averted a major fire at the yard. Sources said that Gade Upender of Gopalraopet in Kusumanchi mandal turned furious when one of the CCI staff members allegedly refused to buy his cotton produce citing certain guidelines. Upender, who had been reportedly camping at the yard since Thursday, pleaded with the CCI staff to purchase his 67 bags of cotton produce without further delay considering his ordeal. However, the staff at the purchase centre reminded him of the stipulated criteria for the purchase of cotton of the prescribed quality parameters. Irked over their attitude, Upender allegedly set afire his cotton bags in a fit of rage. On noticing smoke emanating from the bags that caught fire, fellow farmers doused the flames with the help of the staff. A few cotton bags belonging to a farmer Venkateshwar Rao were also partially damaged. Tension at market yard Tension mounted in the yard following the incident as a group of aggrieved farmers entered into a wordy duel with the staff seeking explanation for the inordinate delay in purchase of their cotton produce. On receipt of the news, revenue and police officials rushed to the yard and brought the situation under control. Orders to CCI An emotionally surcharged Upender recounted his tale of woe to the authorities and sought their intervention to save him from an imminent debt-trap.

        "content": " Pakistans Interior Minister Rehman Malik on Saturday tried to downplay the controversy surrounding his Fridays statements comparing the Mumbai terror attacks with the Babri mosque demolition and the torture of Captain Saurabh Kalia by the Pakistani Army in the Kargil war in 1999. His remarks were taken in a negative way, Mr. Malik told journalists here. My statements have been misunderstoodThere is no comparison, whatsoever, between Babri mosque demolition and 26/11 attacks. When I mentioned Babri masjid I was talking of inter faith harmony in our region inter-faith is really my thought. He further said Pakistan itself was a victim of inter-faith clashes, sectarian strife. My intention was not to create confusion but sound caution to the both countries. So I said like the incidents of 9/11, people dying in Quetta, our Shia and Sunni people are being killed in Karachi. I (had) also said incidents like Mumbai blasts, Babri masjid case we do not want that these things should happen in any region of India and Pakistan. Kalias torture Pointing out that India had never put Captain Kalias torture by the Pakistani army on bilateral agenda, Mr. Malik said: Yesterday was first time India raised (Captain) Kalias case officiallyI only said circumstances of his death are disputed, I am asking for more information. I feel the pain of Captain Kalias fatherI will definitely look into the matter. The Pakistani Minister said if the Pakistani Army had tortured him, why would they have given his dead body? He further said: Yesterday, during the meeting from the first time I was asked to look into the matter. I promised them [Indian delegation] please give me the detail... I will look into the matter and revert with detailed information. I sympathise with his father. Mr. Malik said he would like to meet N.K. Kalia, father of Captain Kalia. I saw his fathers interview [on TV after the Supreme Court directed the Centre to respond to his plea to take up the case in the International Court of Justice]. It was very hard and painful... The matter has not been investigated. We should jointly look into the whole matter, he added. Sarabjits case On the release of Indian death row prisoner Sarabjit Singh, Mr. Malik said once all legal remedies were exhausted, the case would come to the Pakistan President for mercy. I will have to recommend. But I have to see what kind of formalities are required to be followed or completed if he has to apply for mercy petition. Sarabjits sister Daljit Kaur and daughter Sapandeep met Mr. Malik on Friday and appealed for his early release. He had invited both of them visit Pakistan as his personal guest and directed Pakistan High Commission officials to issue them a long-term visa. Meets Sushma PTI reports: Mr. Malik called on Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj and they discussed the problems faced by Hindus living in Pakistan, the progress made in the 26/11 case and the controversy over the Babri mosque demolition.Talking to reporters after the meeting, Ms. Swaraj said she raised two main issues with Mr. Malik.I asked him about the slow pace of the investigation into the 26/11 case and the persecution of Hindus in Pakistan who are coming to India as refugees. The BJP leader said Ms. Malik had asked the Pakistan ambassador to cooperate in handling cases of Hindus who are fleeing Pakistan. She said Ms. Malik invited her to Pakistan. Jundal was agent of Indian intelligence During an interaction with reporters, Mr. Malik claimed that Lashkar-e-Taiba operative Abu Jundal, who was deported from Saudi Arabia, was an agent of Indian intelligence agencies. We are also puzzled. Abu Jundal was a known criminal... He was an agent of Indian intelligence agency ( Wo kisi intelligence agency, Indians ka, ek source bhi raha ). He himself is saying we are not saying. We have seen records. Mr. Malik said that apart from Jundal, two other Indians had gone to Pakistan. We are puzzled. Why did they go to Pakistan? It is a matter of records, he said without elaborating. Jundal is one of the key accused in the Mumbai terror attack case and was allegedly present in the control room set up by the Pakistan-based terror outfit during the three day mayhem in Mumbai in 2008.

        "content": " In a sensational development that impacts the Internet, a group of mainly African nations moved and won a resolution accompanied by a set of binding treaty-based International Telecom Regulations (ITRs) at the UNs World Conference on Internet and Telecommunications (WCIT) in Dubai. The move was supported by China, Russia and mostly Arab states. At the last count, 89 countries had endorsed the global treaty on telecom regulations by Friday, with nearly 45 nations led by the United States, the U.K., the European Union, Japan, Australia and even Kenya, either refusing to sign or buying time to study the proposals. India, which initially backed the ITRs and the accompanying resolution during a sudden vote, later announced that it would sign the Treaty only after consultation with domestic stakeholders. It is now learnt that the matter will be discussed and approved by the Cabinet. Governments do not have to sign immediately and have until January 1, 2015 to ratify the Treaty. Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal has been steadfast in maintaining that he prefers a multi-stakeholder consensus-based process for Internet governance and no role for the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in content regulation. Since this move has larger ramifications, I believe the matter should be addressed by the Cabinet rather than just one ministry, Mr. Sibal told The Hindu . Trust Deficit During the week, the U.S. and European delegations demonstrated their concern over a related development, past midnight on Wednesday, when China, Russia and other allies succeeded in passing a resolution by a show of hands to include the Internet within the ambit of ITU outside the Treaty text. What started as an exercise to check the temperature of the delegates, resulted in the passing of a resolution with majority as announced by the WCIT Chair, Mohamed Nasser Al Ghanim, and Director General of the Telecom Regulation Authority of the UAE. Earlier in the week, a formal proposal by Russia and a secret UAE-led proposal supported by Russia and China surfaced, revealing these countries plans to bring the Internet under intergovernmental control through the ITU. Refusing to sign the Treaty, Ambassador Terry Kramer, head of the U.S. delegation, told a room full of 2,000 delegates from 193 countries, that the United States cannot sign the ITU regulations in its current form. Objections from countries which are refusing to sign the Treaty come on four counts. First, the inclusion of the Internet in the resolution, even though it is not a part of the binding text of the ITRs. Second, on Article 5B relating to unsolicited bulk electronic communication or spam which is seen as an open door to content regulation since spam is considered content. Third, lack of clarity on which agency or entities will be placed under the ITU regulations. And lastly, opposition to the fact that the ITU, an intergovernmental body, should not enter the Internet since it is better served through a transparent, bottom-up multi-stakeholder process. Review in India India said it supports the proposed ITRs and the Resolutions 1, 2, 4 and 5. We support the broad thrust of Resolution Plan 3 regarding an enabling environment for the greater growth of the Internet, particularly its recognition of the multi-stakeholder nature of the Internet and its wider social and economic impact within and across countries around the world. Buying time on directions from Mr. Sibal, India stated, We need to consider the wider ramifications of this Resolution before taking a decision on signing of the ITRs. We would therefore like to undertake necessary consultations at home before announcing our final decision. The need for a rethink arose after a call for a sudden vote led by Iran which took most countries by surprise since voting is seen as divisive on such fora. Especially since the move went against ITU General Secretary Dr. Toures multiple assurances, including a mid-conference Tweet on December 9, that, the key to the success of this conference is consensus.

        "content": " In violation of norms to be followed while handling sexual offences, the Karnataka State Police have been publishing names of the victims of rape and molestation on their official blogs. The necessity to hide the identity of victims has raised a debate in the wake of the recent Delhi gang-rape. The police in every district have launched a blog to post information on cases registered in their jurisdiction on a day-to-day basis. Respective Superintendents of Police are the bloggers. The Hindu conducted a random check of blogs of a few districts and found that many posts related to rape and molestation carry the name of the victims, their parents, details of locality, besides a brief note on the crime allegedly committed. In many of these cases victims are minor girls. What the law says The Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act 2012 strictly prohibit publishing of the names of the victims in sexual offences considering that such disclosure may affect her reputation and also infringe upon her privacy. A 12-year-old girl was allegedly molested by her school headmaster recently in Chikmagalur town. An FIR was registered following a complaint by the mother of the victim. Surprisingly, Chikmagalur district police have published the name of the victim and her mother on their post. In another case, a 14-year-old girl in Chikmagalur Rural police station limits was allegedly raped on January 1, this year. The name of the victim has been posted on the website. A rape of woman was reported in Basavana Bagewadi police station limits in Bijapur district on January 2. The Bijapur district police had no hesitation in publishing the name of the victim. Similarly, the Tumkur police have published the name of the victim in a molestation case reported in Turuvekere police station limits on December 12, 2012. Udupi district police have posted another victims name in a molestation case reported on December 28, 2012, in Gangolli police station limits. The laws bar disclosure of the victims of sexual offences. Clause 23 (2) of the Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act 2012 clearly states: No reports in any media shall disclose the identity of a child, including name, address, photograph, family details, school, neighbourhood or any other particulars which may lead to disclosure of identity of the child. Punishment Going by this clause, the police have violated the norm. Further, the Act states, any person who contravenes the provision shall be liable to be punished with imprisonment of either description for a period which shall not be less than six months, but which may extend to one year or with fine or with both. Similarly Section 228A of Indian Penal Code states that whoever prints or publishes the name of the victim of sexual offences, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine.

        "content": " The movement seeking the release of jailed Kasturi Newz24 reporter Naveen Soorinje gathered pace on Saturday with simultaneous agitations held here and in Mysore. The three-day hunger strike, which started here on Saturday, was supported by dozens of journalists and senior editors from a cross-section of print and electronic media outlets. In an unexpected development, activists belonging to various human rights and progressive organisations also turned up at the venue to express their solidarity with the cause. Gangadhar Mudaliar, president of the Karnataka Union of Working Journalists, said the stir is set to intensify over the next few days. We have instructed all district and taluka-level journalists bodies to launch similar agitations, he said. Mr. Soorinje covering Mangalore district for the channel, was instrumental in exposing the July 28 attack by activists of the Hindu Jagarana Vedike on a group of innocent boys and girls who were celebrating a birthday party at a homestay in Mangalore. He was arrested on November 7 by the Mangalore police on charges ranging from rioting with deadly weapons, criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, and using criminal force on a woman with the intention of outraging her modesty. The police also invoked Sections 3 and 4 of The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act 1986. Those present unanimously backed the view that the charges slapped against Mr. Soorinje were a blatant attempt to muzzle the press. They also held that Mr. Soorinje should have been listed as a witness in the case and not an accused as it was his teams footage that had helped the police identify and nab the culprits. Speaking on behalf of the agitating journalists, editor of Public TV H.R. Ranganath said: Through this arrest, the State government is sending a message to the journalist fraternity that they will be punished for anti-establishment reportage. Ananth Chinivar, editor of Janashree TV said: It is becoming extremely difficult for journalists to function independently and fearlessly in Karnataka. This [Mr. Soorinjes arrest] has set a worrisome precedent. TV9 political editor Lakshman Hoogar said: Through his reportage Mr. Soorinje exposed the right-wing extremism that has taken strong root in coastal Karnataka. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-backed groups, such as the Bajrang Dal and the Hindu Jagarana Vedike, are running amok there unchecked by the police as well as sections of the media. Mr. Soorinje is being punished for carrying critical reports on these groups. Ranganath Bhardwaj, from Suvarna News 24x7, and Badruddin K. Mani, from Kasturi Newz24, were present. Subhash Rai, senior web editor, Economic and Political Weekly , said this is a case where even journalists have been forced to submit to the governments will. Subir Ghosh, resident editor of DNA, said: The state of free speech and expression in Karnataka has degenerated from being unfortunate to downright sorry. V. Sridhar, deputy editor of The Hindu , said: If one cherishes free press, this is a case that is as fundamental as it gets. A journalist was penalised for performing his duty. I am here to show solidarity with him.    OPEN",

Police suspect past enmity between them as Chandra objected to Manoharan having two drinking water pipelines in his house to be the reason for the attack.

Over 100 parents gathered at the Collectorate here on Friday to express their opposition to the move. The Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC) is currently running the liquor shop at a building in Saralai village in the Vijayamangalam block. But the Corporation is taking steps to re-locate the shop to a building located close to a private matriculation school, parents said. Stating that the move was unfortunate, parents said that the shop's proximity to the school would bring in a lot of problems to the students. Children in the school will be able to see the things happening at the shop and the bar from their classrooms. This will distract their attention and affect their studies, Senthil, a parent pointed out. None of us wants a shop close to the school. It is just going to create a lot of trouble for the children, another parent lamented. Persons consuming liquor at the shop were already causing a lot of trouble to the residents in Saralai. If the shop was shifted, students would have to cross it every morning and evening to reach the school. Having the liquor shop so close will leave the students, particularly girls, to face serious problems every day, parents said. Parents met District Revenue Officer Kumaravel Pandian and urged him to take steps to drop the move. Mr. Kumaravel assured the parents that he would look into the issue immediately.  OPEN",

Goa Peoples Forum (GPF), a social organisation and Arz, a Vasco-based organisation working for trafficked women and children expressed deep concern over the missing children and questioned the track record of Goa police in finding kidnapped children or in uploading information about them. Advocate Sonak of GPF said that Goa police does not comply with the guidelines issued by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on tracing missing children. A case was filed with the Goa State Human Rights Commission on Monday. The Commission has directed the State government and police to act swiftly and report to it by September 3. It has now been 20 months since Vikas (four years old at the time) was kidnapped. He is the only child of Sushma and Hanumanta Hebbare, a poor couple from Baina slum in Vasco in south Goa. Recalling the case, Ms. Sushma, told mediapersons that her son was kidnapped from Baina on December 2, 2011. Initially the police registered a missing complaint though she told them her son was kidnapped. She even provided the names of the eyewitnesses who saw her son with the suspected kidnapper. A case of kidnapping was registered only after 10 days with the intervention of Arz. The boy had not been traced till date due to half-hearted and incomplete police investigation, and cruel indifference and inaction of authorities, said the mother. The parents fear that their only child may have been sold and/or made a victim of child trafficking. Ms. Hebbare said that she petitioned Vasco Police Inspector, South Goa Superintendent of Police (SP), south Goa Child Welfare Committee, Director General of Police and Goa Chief Secretary, but there had been no response from any of these authorities. Her application under RTI for information regarding the progress in the case has also been rejected by the police citing that sharing information will affect the investigation of the case. Advocate Sonak said the neglect of the police and officials borders on inhumanity and violates human rights.The GPF and ARZ have demanded that all police officials concerned must publish a photograph of Vikas in newspapers and cause it to be displayed on public places in Goa and Karnataka.

Admitting the complaint filed by KMF Director P. Nagaraj, along with two farmers, the Lokayukta court in Bangalore on Saturday ordered the Lokayukta police to investigate the matter and submit a report. Welcoming the court direction, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha ( KRRS) and Hasiru Sene former general secretary C. Puttaswamy said the KMF was to have procured cattle feed through tender process for the period February to May this year. However, federation officials deliberately postponed the procurement process till July, and had to pay an escalated price of Rs. 14,650 per tonne against the usual price of Rs. 12,800 per tonne, from a company based in Andhra Pradesh. This has added a Rs. 40-crore burden on the federation, which is passing it on to milk producers by increasing cattle feed price by 20 per cent, Mr. Puttaswamy alleged. The KMF had earlier proposed to increase the price by 40 per cent, which was scaled down after a protest, he said. Mr. Puttaswamy charged that Mr. Reddy was feigning ignorance on the issue when he was responsible for scrapping the purchase committee before going for the purchase of the cattle feed. According to the rules, the KMF is supposed to increase the purchase price of milk with the increase of cattle feed price, but this had not been done. Farmers suspect a scam behind this decision and are demanding a CBI probe into the Andhra Pradesh company providing the cattle feed, Mr. Puttaswamy said. Protest in front of KMF In the meantime, thousands of milk producers staged a protest in front of the KMF here on Saturday demanding State intervention to resolve the issue. The protesters demanded that the government should hike the milk price to Rs. 26 per litre and also demanded a strong marketing strategy for milk byproducts. They have also demanded the introduction of 100 ml milk supplement programme for primary schoolchildren to eradicate malnutrition. This would help improve the economic condition of milk producers, they said. The protesters also demanded the services of a nutritional expert to monitor cattle-feed production. They threatened to intensify their protest if their demands are not met within 20 days.

        "content": " Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Prakash Karat has said that the struggle to restructure Centre-State relations must continue to resist the imposition of neo-liberal policies on the States by the Central government. Inaugurating the three-day Third International Congress on Kerala Studies here on Saturday, Mr. Karat accused the Central government of unilateralism and arbitrariness in its decisions resulting in meagre resource devolution to the States and imposition of policies that limited the States' manoeuvrability. While the Centrally-sponsored schemes had over the years led to a shrinking of the divisible pool, the Centre had, of late, developed the habit of arbitrarily and unilaterally reducing its share in financing such schemes. The State governments, already short of resources, were then suddenly with the additional burden of financing schemes in whose formulation they never had a say. Kerala, he said, would be particularly hit by this as the 13 {+t} {+h} Finance Commission had further reduced its share in the total grant-in-aid available to the States. The CPI (M) general secretary said the unilateralism of the Centre was nowhere as evident as in the case of the Right to Information Act. While it was a welcome legislation, the Central government had consistently refused to make available to the States the resources required for implementing it. In the case of Kerala, even the amount set aside by the 13 {+t} {+h} Finance Commission for the purpose is so meagre that the State government will have to spend from its own coffers vast amounts to implement the Central legislation, he said and added that in the case of other schemes such as the comprehensive health insurance scheme, the State government was obliged to hand over to the Centre substantial sums in the form of service tax on them. A third way in which the Centre has started squeezing the States is reminiscent of what private capitalists have been doing for some time. Just as the capitalists make State governments vie with one another for attracting investments to their respective States by offering larger concessions, the Central government too had started deciding on the location of Central projects on the basis of which the State gives larger concessions. If a railway project is to be located in Kerala, then the Kerala government has to offer free land of the railways' choice for the project. Then the Railways intend to go for a public-private partnership without giving the State government any stake in the project. The same is true of airport renovation and a host of other projects of the Central government, or of its undertakings. This is contrary to the spirit of cooperative federalism, Mr. Karat said. Kerala, he said, devised strategies to enhance value addition in agriculture, went in for effective use of biotechnology, evolved a growth strategy which focussed on economic activities that intensively used skilled labour, expanded employment opportunities for the millions of educated women in the State, reviewed how decentralisation of powers and resources to panchayats and local bodies had worked and ensured that the path of economic growth was environmentally sustainable. Kerala Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan chaired the inaugural session, which was attended by, among others, CPI (M) Polit Bureau member S. Ramachandran Pillai, party State secretary Pinarayi Vijayan, Polit Bureau member and State Home Minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, Jnanpith-winning poet O.N.V. Kurup, State Planning Board Vice-Chairman Prabhat Patnaik, Congress deputy legislature party leader G. Karthikeyan, Culture Minister M.A. Baby and Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac.  OPEN",

The group comprises the former Chief Justice of India M.N. Venkatachaliah, the former Director General and Inspector-General of Police T. Madiyal, retired IPS officers N.B. Bhat, H.R. Kasturi Rangan and Suresh Babu, and the former legislators Anna Vinayachandra, Ramachandra Reddy and Munivenkata Reddy among others. The group held a preliminary meeting in Bangalore on Saturday to decide on their future course of action to fight corruption. Social activist Abraham and the former legislators Ejasuddin and L.T. Thimmappa Hegde and retired IAS officer D. Gangappa were also present. Mr. Venkatachaliah underlined the need for instilling faith in democracy among the common people so that they become confident of getting justice through democratic means. To achieve this, Mr. Venkatachaliah said that he had in the past suggested to the Lokayukta to form hobli-level teams comprising officials from the Lokayukta, the State Human Rights Commission and the police complaints authority to address peoples grievances. Stressing the need to fight corruption in a bid to strengthen democracy, Mr. Venkatachaliah called upon people to tirelessly engage with institutions like the Lokayukta, Election Commission and the High Court to protect democracy. You should make use of these institutions tirelessly and constantly if you want to safeguard democracy. It is only through struggles and fights that you can save and strengthen the countrys democracy, he said. Describing democracy as the finest invention of mankind, he said: Democracy ensures that people are governed no better than they deserve. We have reduced democracy into a situation where a voter can auction his vote to the highest bidder against the spirit of the democracy, he said. The former MLA Ramachandra Reddy spoke.

        "content": " Earlier this month, a pedestrian who tried to cross the arterial Bellary Road near the CBI office was run over by a car. She had reached halfway and was trying to negotiate the 2-feet-high road divider when tragedy struck. Why did Ameena Shaikh, a call centre employee, not take the pedestrian underpass? Because it was 6.30 a.m. and she did not feel safe in the dark and dank subway. Even in the best of times, most of our pedestrian underpasses double as toilets, get flooded when it rains, and are a haven for anti-social elements. The Hindu team visited the pedestrian underpasses at K.R. Circle, Nrupatunga Road and the CBI junction on Bellary Road and none of them passed muster. With most lights not functioning, it was no wonder many pedestrians risk their lives by darting across busy roads instead. Womens voices  Smita S., who was crossing the road in front of St. Marthas Hospital even though the pedestrian underpass was just a few metres away, said she found the underpass impractical. Gayathri J., a senior citizen, said it was difficult for elderly persons like herself to use the stairs in the underpasses. Besides, it is dark [in there] and I would rather just cross the road, she said. R. Vanajakshi, a government employee, said due to poor lighting, underpasses had become a haven for anti-social elements. When it rains, the underpasses often get flooded. Divya M.S., a student, was darting across the road near the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering. She did not use the underpasses as it was unsafe. Safety in numbers Of course there are the few who do use the facility. Radhika M.K. said she did so only because there was no other option to cross the road there. The trick was to cover the nose, look down and walk as fast as one can. And then there are some women who do so only in groups. It is only during the day and when we are in groups that we use the underpass, said Golma, a student. It is not just women who feel the underpasses are unsafe. Obulesh Sake, branch manager, State Bank of India, City Market, said the underpasses were deserted in the evening, especially after 7.30 p.m. The usual noises A senior Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) official, when contacted, conceded that all the citys pedestrian underpasses were in a poor condition. Without commenting on the failure of the civic authority in maintaining the underpasses, he blandly said the BBMP would soon improve the underpasses.  OPEN",

He vowed to fulfil the dreams of late Rajasekhara Reddy and reiterated that he would follow the progressive path laid by the departed leader.

        "content": " Some crimes are detected within hours, others take days, investigation lasts for months and years in some cases and a few remain unravelled permanently. Instances of investigators getting misled are not unheard of. But it is rare that a man suspected of murder turns out to be the victim of perfunctory investigation of the police and languishes in prison for no fault of his. The murder of a hotel worker, Tarun, in which the Narayanaguda police arrested a footpath dweller, E. Srinivas Goud, is one such case explaining how hasty investigation defeats the principles of jurisprudence that not a single innocent person be punished even if hundred accused escape. Police shocked Goud's innocence would have never come to light if the same Narayanaguda police did not arrest a sexagenarian, Ramachandran Rathore, while pursuing the murder of an apartment building watchman's son. Confessing to the killing of the watchman's son, Rathore also revealed that he had earlier killed Tarun after a drunken brawl. Shocked at his admission contradicting their finding that Goud had murdered the hotel worker, police ordered re-investigation of the case by the Hyderabad Detective Department. After a thorough probe, the detectives confirmed that Goud was a victim and not the accused. Tarun was found murdered on the roadside on July 12 morning with wounds on his head. Goud lay next to him with bleeding injuries on his face. After examining the scene of offence, the police said someone beat up Tarun and killed him by smashing his head with a boulder. Attempts to ascertain facts from Goud turned futile as he was found in highly intoxicated condition'. Few days later, they arrested Goud holding him guilty of the murder. The first faux pas in the case, the reinvestigation had found, was failure to establish what strong motive the footpath dweller had to eliminate Tarun. Even if they overlooked the motive point, the inadequate evidence at the crime scene connecting him to the murder too was ignored. Sloppy investigation The angle of the possible involvement of a third person in the murder, since Goud too sustained injuries, was not pursued. Nature of injuries sustained by Goud and the murder victim was not compared resulting in faulty reconstruction of the crime scene. It is a moot point if the disciplinary action being initiated against the Narayanaguda Inspector and the Abids ACP compensates the injustice meted out to Goud. But the case has sure taught investigators why they should not jump to conclusions.

Despite repeated appeals from the authorities, the government has been failing to fill the vacant posts. According to sources, there are about 100 veterinary doctor posts in the department and out of them 47 are vacant. This comes to nearly half of the required staff in the district. The posts are lying vacant for the past four years and repeated efforts by the authorities in the district to draw the attention of the higher officials have failed to yield any result. We have reported the situation at least 15 times to our officers at Hyderabad. They are suggesting us to redeploy the staff wherever required stating that there are many other districts which are doing away with less number of staff as compared to Medak, said an officer of the animal husbandry department on condition of anonymity. However, the officials have no details on how many animals might have died in the past four years but they admit that at least three animals per thousand would die due to lack of timely medical help. There are about five lakh black animals, four lakh white animals, 11 lakh sheep, five lakh goats and one crore poultry. There are mandals like Narayanakhed and Kalher which are highly backward where no veterinary doctor was available and farmers have to depend on Gopalamitras and paramedics for any urgent health issue of animals. The officials are not ready to quantify the loss incurred by the farmers stating that they do not have data regarding the death of animals. At the same time, they said that one of the insurance companies had paid a compensation of about Rs. 2 crore from April 2012 to December for claims made for about 1,000 animals. Out of the 20,000 animals insured with that company, claims were submitted for 1,000 animals.

Food habits of the people, usage of pesticides in agricultural activity will also be observed. The detailed survey will be conducted for three years to find out permanent solution to the problem and save at least next generation from the dreaded disease. Addressing a media conference on Saturday, AITAM director V.V. Nageswara Rao hoped that the new survey conducted by eminent doctors, technicians and hydrologists would save at least young generation from kidney diseases. Andhra Pradesh Academy of Sciences will coordinate the activities of various organisations so that there would not be any chance for haphazard survey.

The protest was held on an allegation that a retired employee of the university tried to enter the confidential section of Pareeksha Bhavan on Thursday. Twenty-one students, most of them aligned to the KSU and the MSF, were injured in the clash with the SFI activists. Tension prevailed in the area as members of the Calicut University Staff Organisation, aligned to the Congress, and the Calicut University Employees' Union, aligned to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), came out in support of their respective student organisations. Probe sought The injured students alleged that the police had remained mute spectators when the SFI activists unleashed violence. They demanded an inquiry into the suspicious entry of a retired staff member to the confidential section. Charges denied The SFI leaders denied the allegations, and said there was no convincing reason for the protest. They only prevented the KSU activists from destroying a box kept in front of Pareeksha Bhavan. During the attempt, three SFI activists were manhandled by the KSU activists.

The government should clarify why people are kept waiting till January 6 to know the contents of the report, he said. Addressing a press conference here on Friday, he said deployment of central forces in Telangana was part of efforts to forcibly impose the recommendations made by Justice Srikrishna Committee which had no statutory backing.

With only Rs. 50 in her pocket, she took off in a bus to Villupuram, where she met a woman who tricked her and locked her in a room for three days without giving her any food or water. She managed to escape, only to end up in a government hospital in Tiruvannamalai,weakened by hunger and fatigue, where she was molested by a doctor. Every year, many schoolchildren like Kamala face molestation at schools which leaves a lasting impact on them. Marking the International Day for Violence against Women, the Tamil Nadu Womens Collective has organised a 16-day campaign, protesting various forms of violence against women in society, from November 25 till December 10. Ten to fifteen years ago, most of the cases were of domestic violence. But in the past decade, a significant number of schoolchildren have been victims of sexual harassment, said Sheelu, president of the womens collective. The organisations volunteers work in 16 districts in Tamil Nadu, counselling women and children traumatised by sexual harassment and helping them get back on their feet. This year, out of a total of 128 such cases, the counsellors worked with 17 cases involving schoolchildren. Parents of the victims are left with the responsibility of nursing and helping their children move on. Kamalas mother complains about the lack of sensitivity on the local polices part. The police have the wrong outlook when it comes to these cases. Instead of helping, they threaten the victims. They need to be educated to be able to handle such cases well, she said. Students of colleges including Stella Maris, MOP Vaishnav, Queen Marys and Presidency came to show their solidarity with the cause at the walkathon rally held on the Marina beach on Monday. The campaign aims to get the Chennai Corporation take up the responsibility of dealing with unsafe areas in the city. Apart from poorly-lit public places, a few students complained about the MRTS station at the Triplicane Beach.

The suspects gained access to the house by cutting through a grill gate and breaking open two doors. Sources with the Valasaravakkam police said the burglary took place at the residence of Thenraj (35), a businessman dealing in inverters, on Seyon Street, Madurai Meenakshi Nagar where he resides with his family. Four days ago, Thenraj left for Kerala on business. His wife Radha (31) along with their children Shahana and Kishore went to her parents house in Thiruthani, while Thenrajs father Karuppusamy (67) stayed back. As his daughter, who resides in nearby Sridevi Kuppam, fell ill, Karuppusamy had gone to her house around 4 p.m. on Sunday after locking all the doors and the grille gate of the house. My father returned to the house around 6 a.m. on Monday morning and found the iron gate in the front cut open and the doors broken. Gold jewellery weighing 70 sovereigns, 1.5 kg of silver items, over Rs. 1.5 lakh and a hundi were missing from an almirah, Thenrajs brother Senthil Kumar told The Hindu . The burglars had brought duplicate keys for opening the almirah but did not have to use them as the almirah had been locked and the keys placed on top of it. The culprits stole the valuables and abandoned the duplicate keys in the house. The Valasaravakkam police team carried out a preliminary probe and have registered a case of burglary. A year ago, a burglar struck at Thenrajs house in the night and attempted to steal a gold chain from a woman resident. But he was caught red-handed and handed over to the Valasaravakkam police, sources said.  OPEN",

Kannabiran saying the civil liberties movement in the country has suffered an irreparable loss in his passing away. The eminent civil rights activist, who died in Hyderabad on Thursday after a brief illness, had visited Rajasthan several times during the hosting of national and state conferences in Jaipur, Udaipur and Chittaurgarh. He was in regular touch with the civil rights activists in the State, providing them guidance for raising contemporary issues. PUCL State president Prem Krishna Sharma said here on Friday that the loss was particularly shocking as it had come within a fortnight of the death of Surendra Mohan, another stalwart in the field, and in less than a week of the judgment delivered by a court in Raipur awarding life imprisonment to Binayak Sen. The conviction of [Dr.] Binayak Sen for life had left Mr. Kannabiran extremely sorrowful, said Mr. Sharma, who is also a lawyer at the Rajasthan High Court. Mr. Sharma noted that Mr. Kannabiran was the PUCL president for more than 17 years and an eminent lawyer with long years of experience in the courts, having single-handedly taken up more than 400 public interest litigations. For the tremendous amount of work done by him in the field of civil liberties, he was considered a one-man army by his colleagues. PUCL State general secretary Kavita Srivastava remembered Mr. Kannabiran as having working with the foremost civil liberties organisation in the country in the company of Justice V. M. Tarkunde, Justice Rajinder Sachar, Justice R. B. Mehrotra and Mr. Surendra Mohan. She said he was instrumental in mediating between the Naxalites and the State several times in Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Kannabiran regularly wrote articles for the PUCL Bulletin apart from contributing to various magazines and newspapers. The Wages of Impunity: Power, Justice and Human Rights authored by him in 2004 is known to be his most read book.  OPEN",

        "content": " As doctor and human rights activist Binayak Sen spends New Year's Day in prison as the only person to be convicted on sedition charges in 2010, it is worth noting that at least five others have also faced the charge over the course of the year. Most of these have been charged for their statements with regard to either the Naxal issue or the Kashmir conflict, according to media watchdog site, TheHoot.org. Sedition is a crime dealt with in Section 124 A of the Indian Penal Code, which says that whoever by written or spoken words, or by signs or visible representations attempts or brings into hatred or contempt or attempts or excites disaffection towards the government established by law shall be punishable with life imprisonment. This was one of the charges that Dr. Sen was found guilty of last week. Perhaps the best known sedition cases of 2010 are those of celebrity activist and writer Arundhati Roy and Hurriyat leader S.A.P. Geelani, both of whom were charged for speeches they made at an October seminar on Kashmir titled Azaadi -- the only way. While the government initially decided not to initiate any criminal proceedings against the speeches, a Delhi city court directed the police to respond to the demand for a criminal case made by a group of Kashmiri Pandits. The High Court issued a similar notice in response to a PIL. Despite the police reporting that the accused had made no inflammatory speeches, the Metropolitan Magistrate directed the police to file an FIR and submit a report to the court by January 6, 2011. Rati Rao case The most bizarre case may have been that of E. Rati Rao, vice president of the Karnataka chapter of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, who was issued a sedition notice by the Vijayanagara police for bringing out an in-house bulletin in Kannada called PUCL Karnataka Varthapatra. Not only was the bulletin meant for private circulation only, its publication had actually been discontinued in September 2007, three years before the sedition notice was issued. Is the law on sedition being invoked a little too often for a democracy that values free speech? asks TheHoot.org's Free Speech Hub which tracked these sedition cases. In other cases, an environmental activist was charged with sedition for disrupting a government Republic Day function in Salem, Tamil Nadu by distributing Tamil pamphlets questioning the displacement of lakhs of tribals due to Operation Green Hunt and the non-implementation of a Supreme Court order for the rehabilitation of Chhattisgarh villagers. On the other end of the country, a lecturer of a Srinagar government college was arrested for allegedly setting an examination paper filled with questions related to the recent unrest in the Kashmir Valley. The police termed the question paper anti-Indian and seditious.  OPEN",

This is significant, as it is the first public meeting held by the Left there since the area became an epicentre of Maoist activities and the Maoist-backed Police Santrash Birodhi Janasadharaner Committee (PSBJC) two years ago. Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee was unsuccessful in ousting the Communist Party of India (Marxist) from this region so she asked Maoist leader Kishenji to do this task for them, said Sushanta Ghosh, the State's Minister for Paschimanchal Unnayan Affairs. Kishenji is now repeatedly saying that he wants to see Ms. Banerjee as the next Chief Minister, he added. Dipak Sarkar, secretary, District Committee of the CPI(M), attended the rally. The rally was held less than two months after a large number of CPI (M) supporters, evicted from their homes in the face of Maoist onslaught, returned. Bearing the party flag, an estimated 12,000 people marched from Dharampur to Lalgarh and reopened the CPI (M) local committee office there, closed since June 16, 2009. Commenting on the rally, Biman Bose, Chairman of the State Left Front Committee, told journalists that it is not fair to compare it with Trinamool's August 9 rally addressed by Ms. Banerjee. Supporters of the Trinamool from other districts had also gone to the rally in August, but this rally was only limited to one block of the district. Asked to comment on the ongoing controversy over the exchange of letters between Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram and West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Mr. Bose said the language of Mr. Chidambaram's letter resembled that of the deputation submitted to him by the Trinamool.

Central Information Commissioner Sailesh Gandhi, who heard the case of Bir Singh at a Right to Information hearing here, was so anguished by the farmer's plight that he made this recording on December 30: The Commission realises that this old, barely literate complainant is hurt at the complete callousness of his government. He realises that his younger brother was able to get his plot by corrupt means and waits helplessly  intimidated by the bureaucracy and the government system which takes away his land, and gives him no promise of when he will get the alternative plot. This Commission is unable to help him but hopes that somebody sensitive enough in the government will realise that the poor and disempowered cannot be harassed like this endlessly Mr. Bir Singh, who had knocked on all possible doors to know whether his application for alternative land had been processed, decided finally to take the RTI route. With help from his neighbour Guru Dutt, he filed an application with the Land & Building Department of the Delhi Government. He had one query: When would his file be put up for scrutiny before the sub-committee on alternative allotments? The Public Information Officer of the L&B Department said the case did not come under the RTI but offered to let Mr. Bir Singh inspect his file. But since Mr. Bir Singh was unlettered, he asked whether Mr. Dutt could accompany him for the inspection. The Department refused permission, forcing Mr. Bir Singh to go through the mockery of reading a file he did not understand. He was also made to sign on a blank paper. Mr. Bir Singh related this incident to Mr. Gandhi at the first hearing on December 13. A furious CIC wrote: The Commission condemns such behaviour by government officers who are dealing with poor, barely literate people. Later, Mr. Bir Singh gave Mr. Gandhi a curious nugget of information: his brother, with whom he had jointly owned the surrendered piece of land, had got an alternative plot. Mr. Gandhi immediately understood the reason for the discrepancy. His response: A stinging order with a pointed reference to corruption. Mr. Gandhi told The Hindu: I am frustrated at being unable to help. To me, this is open robbing of a poor man by the State. Unlettered Bir Singh allowed to read a file and made to sign on a blank paper   Information Commissioner terms it an open robbing of a poor man by the state  OPEN",

Anand Kumar, a resident of second main, Kirloskar Layout in Peenya, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his room in the second floor of his house by his wife who went to serve him coffee. Preliminary investigation revealed that Anand Kumar, who used to supply construction material, including sand, to builders, incurred loss due to failure in the business. He had availed himself of loans from banks, private financiers and his friends and could not repay due to loss in business. The police suspected that he may have taken the extreme step due to dejection over his inability to repay loan. Anand Kumar had told his wife that he was depressed because of loans, according to the police. On Sunday, he woke up and went to a nearby shop to buy milk at 6.15 a.m. After handing over the milk to his wife, he told her that he would return to bed. He was a native of a village near Dobbspet.

The State government officials were under pressure after three deaths, including that of a doctor and a nurse, under mysterious circumstances earlier this week. The NIV identified the mystery virus as the very rare Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), which was found in Pakistan in 2009 and seen for the first time in India. Almost the entire village of Kolat  from where the first patient, Ameena Momin, was admitted in a private hospital in Ahmedabad  was quarantined. The government was under pressure as the doctor and nurse who had attended on Ameena in the hospital, also died a few days later with similar symptoms. About 70 samples of blood and saliva were collected from in Kolat villagers as well as some staff-members of the private hospital where Ameena was admitted, and sent to the Pune institute. The Health Minister, Jaynarayan Vyas, said here on Thursday that the report from the NIV had been received by the State government and all the samples were found negative for CCHF. Mr. Vyas said that of the four persons suspected to be suffering from CCHF, including close family-members of Ameena, one had tested negative, further strengthening the government's belief that the virus had not spread uncontrollably in the region. We are, however, not letting our guard down and teams are still surveying the environs besides checking almost all hospitals in the State to ascertain things for ourselves, Mr. Vyas said. He said all the hospitals had been asked to initiate steps to create isolation wards at very short notice, should such a need arise. At least 30 teams of doctors and about 15 teams of veterinary surgeons are camping in Kolat and surrounding villages but official sources said not a single suspected case of the virus had been found either among people or domesticated animals, which are believed to be the carriers of the virus. Official sources also said the condition of Ameena's husband and some other members of the family who had earlier shown similar symptoms was stable and improving. The NICD team, led by its Joint Director U.B. Rana, visited the affected areas after a preliminary discussion with the State health authorities. The team split into two, one going to Kolat village, and the other, the different hospitals where the three victims of the disease were treated. Dr. Rana appreciated the quick steps taken by the State government to control the situation soon after the three deaths were reported and said the team had received full co-operation from the State authorities.

According to Aboobakar of Kulai, a group of six persons came in a multi-utility vehicle and assaulted Jamaluddin, owner of a grocery shop, and his relative Shakeel with iron rods and hockey sticks. The group then damaged the adjoining shop. The incident occurred a few minutes after Shivarajs body was taken in a procession to Kodikere.

Singh said defence modernisation and indigenisation was possible only through a synergy between government, Defence Public Sector Undertakings and the private sector. The Indian defence industrial base was sure to expand and wanted private industries to participate in indigenisation and take calculated risks in investment.

The 22-year-old Dalit boy from Ramgarh in western Uttar Pradesh was brutally beaten up by members of the dominant Gujjar community and tied to the railway tracks. Though he struggled to free himself, Ram suffered grievous injuries as a train ran over his legs. According to Rams father Sheeshpal, who is waiting for his son to come out of the state of unconsciousness, doctors at AIIMS are not very positive about his survival because of the excessive bleeding after his legs were crushed. The police at the Dadri police station, which initially not taking any action, registered a case of attempt to murder against four people that Tika Ram had named after activists belonging to the All-India Students Association and All-India Progressive Womens Association protested. Those who have been named in the FIR include Kaalu Bhati, brother of village pradhan Kuldeep Bhati, who belongs to the Gujjar community. Activists said the attack on Tika Ram was directly related to a dispute over 4.75 bighas of panchayat land allocated to the 60 Jatav families by the State Government. The land has been allegedly occupied by the gram pradhan, Kuldeep Bhati. The Constitution mandates the allocation of a fixed share of panchayat land in every village to Dalit families so that they can build houses or cattle sheds on them. The Government had even issued pattas (title deeds) for the land in 1982. But the Gujjars, who are financially stronger, built a seven-foot-high wall around the land last December, restricting the movement of the Jatavs in their own land. Sandeep Singh, the national president of AISA, who is a part of the civil society protest against the encroachment on the land by the Gujjars, said the attack on Tika Ram was part of a series of retaliatory attacks on Dalit youths who have been at the forefront of the protest against the land encroachment. On March 14, Gujjars went to the Dalit colony on the margins of the village armed with sticks, country-made pistols and axes, and beat up its residents in broad daylight, severely injuring many. During the rampage, which lasted more than three hours, the Gujjars did not spare even women and children. The police did not arrive in time despite several phone calls to them. Gujjars want to suppress all kind of voice of protest against their oppression on the Dalits in the village and the attack on Tika Ram was aimed at that, added the AISA leader. Mr. Singh alleged that in order to deflect attention from the ongoing protest against land encroachment, the Gujjars have falsely named Tika Ram in a case of attempt to murder which is related to an incident of firing on a girl belonging to the Gujjar community few days ago.

In a curious turn of events, after locking the resident and her son in the house, the woman fled on a motorcycle by tricking the rider, an acquaintance of the victim. Sources with the Royapettah police identified the victim as Venmathi (32) and said the robbery took place at her ground-floor residence at Pudupet Garden 3{+r}{+d}Street in Royapettah. Around 2 p.m. on Tuesday, Venmathi was feeding her five-year-old son who had returned from school. As the boy insisted on watching television, she locked the house and went to her in-laws house next door. Within 15 minutes, she returned with her son to find a woman, dressed in a yellow sari and beads, coming out of her house. A shocked Venmathi questioned the women who claimed to be a devotee. The suspect, who had pocketed the gold and the cash from the house, told Venmathi that she had come in search of one Vijaya, a milk-sachet vendor. When Venmathi confronted her, she claimed she had got the wrong address and started crying, claiming that she was a devotee and not a thief. Then she asked for some water to drink, said an investigating officer. While Venmathi and her son were entering the house, the suspect pushed them inside, bolted the main door from outside and fled. Hearing Venmathis cries for help, her mother-in-law came to the spot and the two women along with neighbours went searching for the woman. The suspect, however, escaped.

We have deliberately stayed out of any commitment to tackle Left Wing Extremism, except for giving advice or training, Chief of Army Staff General V.K. Singh said at the annual press conference on the eve of the Army Day. Gen. Singh said the Army was facing problem in training its personnel as there was not enough land available and the proposal to set it up in Chhattisgarh under the Central Command forms part of an integrated plan drawn earlier. Since the Army would be present in the area, it had sought for clarifications from the government on Rules of Engagement' to determine the extent to which its personnel were protected from civil laws. Gen. Singh said the clarification was needed to determine how to engage attackers in case of attacks on the training camp, either by instigation or design. While it is clear that the force does not require any permission to fire in self-defence, the issue is whether resultant causalities on the attackers would attract criminal procedures against the Army personnel and to what extent they are exempt. We are neither operating in the area nor are seeking protection under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, the Army Chief said. At the same time, he sought to make a distinction from the Indian Air Force, which had earlier sought and got permission to fire from its helicopters while on a mission to transport men and material in Naxal-infested regions of Chhattisgarh. The IAF had asked for permission to use retaliatory fire from helicopters after one of its platforms came under attack while ferrying material for elections. The Army has sought nearly 600 sq.km. of land in the forest area and according to sources, the Chhattisgarh government has accepted the necessity, but yet to determine the quantum of land. The sources said live firing is not part of the training which will largely concentrate on manoeuvres and other skills.

The test is conducted for job confirmations, promotions and increments. The police received a complaint from the office of the Principal Chief Controller of Accounts, Central Board of Direct Taxes, stating that Prateek Trikha and Sonu Kumar, the two LDCs had appeared in the bi-monthly test conducted by the Staff Selection Commission. The Department received a letter dated April 2012 purportedly from the SSC saying that the two candidates had cleared the examinations. However, suspecting the authenticity of the letter, officials concerned cross-checked with the SSC and learnt that the results for the test had not been declared yet and that no letters had been issued in this regard. Inquiries revealed that the signatures on the letters in question were of an official who had already retired. A copy of the specimen signature of the incumbent official was also provided for verification. The complaint alleged the signatures on the letters in question were later washed with water/ink to destroy the evidence. The typing test is mandatory for lower-division clerks for entitlement to increments, confirmation or promotions. A preliminary inquiry is being conducted where the officials in question have denied their involvement in the issuance of fake letters from the SSC, said the complaint, based on which a case has been registered at the Tughlak Road police station.

Five Nigerian men and three women  two from Mozambique and one from Thailand  were arrested on April 13, 2009, from a house in Sant Garh and charged under the the NDPS Act for possession of 7 kg of heroin. During the trial, the accused had claimed they were falsely implicated by the police. The court noted the contention of the five arrested men that they were arrested only because the male Nigerians, who were the actual tenants in the raided house, had managed to escape and the police arrested them as they also happened to be Nigerians residing nearby. The arrested women said they were invited to the house for an Easter dinner and they had nothing to do with the seized contraband.  OPEN",

In a statement, it said that the Army officer detained by the former Army chiefs family had gone there to remove a telephone exchange as part of withdrawal of Gen. Singhs Z-plus security category with effect from November last year. After the controversy broke out, Delhi Area Commander Lt. Gen. Subroto Mitra went to Gen. Singhs house here at Mandir Marg in the Delhi Cantonment after which the matter was sorted out amicably, the Army Headquarters said, adding that Lt. Gen. Mitra had expressed regret for the inconvenience caused. Communication gap Due to a communication gap somewhere, a Signals Regiment party went to remove the Army exchange and lines at the Mandir Marg house of Gen. V.K. Singh. Mrs. V.K. Singh objected to the removal of the exchange without prior notice, the Army said in a statement, and added: The lack of advance information caused slight resentment. The matter was amicably resolved by [the] intervention of [the]GOC Delhi Area. The Army respects all its retired Chiefs and senior officers and will continue to do so. In deference to Mrs. Singhs objection, the team returned without removing the exchange. The house was provided to Gen. Singh by the Defence Ministry for one year after he retired on May 31 last year. The Army said the officer talked to Gen. Singhs daughter to take directions for establishing direct lines in the house and also got her to talk to the Commanding Officer of his unit. Gen. Singh has himself been in the midst of a row following allegations that during his tenure as Army Chief he had used sophisticated off-the-air interceptors to snoop on officials of Defence Ministry at the height of the controversy over his age. The specialised unit Technical Support Division is now being disbanded. Gen Singh, who was in Gujarat at the time of the incident, arrived here on Saturday evening.  PTI  OPEN",

        "content": " Expressing serious concern at the increasing incidents of crime against women, the Supreme Court has asked trial courts and High Courts to award deterrent punishment in such cases. In spite of stringent legislation to curb the deteriorating condition of women across the country, cases of bride burning, cruelty, suicide, sexual harassment, rape, suicide by married women, etc, have increased and are taking place day by day. A complete overhaul of the system is a must in the form of deterrent punishment to the offenders so that we can effectively deal with the problem, a Bench of Justices P Sathasivam and Ranjan Gogoi said, upholding the life sentence awarded to two women who, along with their mother, burnt to death, their sister-in-law. Vandana died within three years of her marriage, harassed by her mother-in-law Kesharbai and sisters-in-law Ashabai and Kavita (appellants) because of her inability to conceive a child. She was burnt to death, having been doused with kerosene. The prosecution case was that on March 5, 2003, when Vandana was in her matrimonial home, Kesharbai poured kerosene on her and Ashabai and Kavita instigated her to light the fire with a matchstick. Vandana died of burns on April 18, 2003. Writing the judgment, Justice Sathasivam said: The entire prosecution case lies on four dying declarations made by the deceased and the oral evidence of four witnesses. She specifically implicated her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law for pouring kerosene [on her] and lighting fire. On the appellants contention that the version given by the deceased in all the four dying declarations was inconsistent, the Bench said: The incident took place in the bedroom of the deceased. It is also clear that she was subjected to torture as she had not conceived a child even after three years of marriage and in all the four declarations, she was conscious of mentioning the role of her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law. The Bench said: The insistence on corroboration of a dying declaration is only a rule of prudence. When the court is satisfied that the dying declaration is voluntary, not tainted by tutoring or animosity and is not a product of the imagination, there is no impediment to convicting the accused on the basis of such a declaration. When there are multiple declarations, each has to be separately assessed and evaluated for its evidentiary value, and one cannot be rejected because of certain variations in the other. It is clear that the statement made by the deceased [Vandana] by way of a declaration is admissible as evidence under Section 32(1) of the Evidence Act. The Bench dismissed the appeal and upheld the life imprisonment awarded to Ashabai and Kavitha by the trial court and confirmed by the Bombay High Court. Kesharbai, who also filed a separate appeal, died on February 2, 2012.

        "content": " Opposing the death penalty for those guilty of rape, womens groups have demanded that marital rape, stalking and stripping be regarded as serious offences. The old Penal Code and the proposed amendments exempt marital rape as an offence if a wife is not under 16 years of age. This exemption, totally and unreasonably, ignores the long standing demand of the womens organisations and groups to recognise marital rape as a serious offence, womens groups have said in a representation to the Justice Verma Committee that was set up in the aftermath of the horrific gang-rape in the capital last month. We also recommend deletion of Section 376 A as we see no reason why the punishment for sexual assault on a separated wife should not be the same as ordinary sexual assault, the representation has said while suggesting that consent be also defined as the unequivocal voluntary agreement by a person to engage in the sexual activity in question. One major reason for defining consent in this way is to distinguish consent from mere passiveness. Case law concerning rape is replete with examples in which it has been said that the victim has consented when she has merely remained passive due to a variety of reasons, the groups have said. The joint representation was given by the All India Democratic Womens Association, All India Womens Conference, Centre for Womens Development Studies, Joint Women Programme, Guild of Service, All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch, National Federation of Indian Women, Young Womens Christian Association of India, and Muslim Womens Forum. We have been suggesting that stalking be recognised as a separate offence in the IPC and that an appropriate punishment should be prescribed for it up to 5 years. By not recognising stalking as a crime, most of the perpetrators manage to escape prosecution and can only be charged under Section 509 IPC which is inadequate. Similarly, stripping a woman should also be recognised as a serious sexual offence, the representation says. Rehabilitation Pointing out that relief and rehabilitation of the victim has become an urgent necessity in all cases of sexual assault and other violent crimes like acid attacks, womens groups have said that statutory schemes to provide immediate medical and other relief should immediately be put in place in all States. The scheme should provide for immediate monetary relief to be given to the complainant whether her case is pending in court or not. The amount that is provided should not be subject to an upper limit as has presently been suggested by the National Commission for Women as some victims of violence like those who have suffered acid attacks may need extensive and repeated medical attention apart from other relief.

        "content": " The movement seeking the release of jailed Kasturi Newz24 reporter Naveen Soorinje gathered pace on Saturday with simultaneous agitations held here and in Mysore. The three-day hunger strike, which started here on Saturday, was supported by dozens of journalists and senior editors from a cross-section of print and electronic media outlets. In an unexpected development, activists belonging to various human rights and progressive organisations also turned up at the venue to express their solidarity with the cause. Gangadhar Mudaliar, president of the Karnataka Union of Working Journalists, said the stir is set to intensify over the next few days. We have instructed all district and taluka-level journalists bodies to launch similar agitations, he said. Mr. Soorinje covering Mangalore district for the channel, was instrumental in exposing the July 28 attack by activists of the Hindu Jagarana Vedike on a group of innocent boys and girls who were celebrating a birthday party at a homestay in Mangalore. He was arrested on November 7 by the Mangalore police on charges ranging from rioting with deadly weapons, criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, and using criminal force on a woman with the intention of outraging her modesty. The police also invoked Sections 3 and 4 of The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act 1986. Those present unanimously backed the view that the charges slapped against Mr. Soorinje were a blatant attempt to muzzle the press. They also held that Mr. Soorinje should have been listed as a witness in the case and not an accused as it was his teams footage that had helped the police identify and nab the culprits. Speaking on behalf of the agitating journalists, editor of Public TV H.R. Ranganath said: Through this arrest, the State government is sending a message to the journalist fraternity that they will be punished for anti-establishment reportage. Ananth Chinivar, editor of Janashree TV said: It is becoming extremely difficult for journalists to function independently and fearlessly in Karnataka. This [Mr. Soorinjes arrest] has set a worrisome precedent. TV9 political editor Lakshman Hoogar said: Through his reportage Mr. Soorinje exposed the right-wing extremism that has taken strong root in coastal Karnataka. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-backed groups, such as the Bajrang Dal and the Hindu Jagarana Vedike, are running amok there unchecked by the police as well as sections of the media. Mr. Soorinje is being punished for carrying critical reports on these groups. Ranganath Bhardwaj, from Suvarna News 24x7, and Badruddin K. Mani, from Kasturi Newz24, were also present. Subhash Rai, senior web editor, Economic and Political Weekly , said this is a case where even journalists have been forced to submit to the governments will. If the government can demonstrate such impunity towards the journalists, it is unimaginable what they will do to the public, he added. Subir Ghosh, resident editor of DNA, said: The state of free speech and expression in Karnataka has degenerated from being unfortunate to downright sorry. V. Sridhar, deputy editor of The Hindu , said: If one cherishes free press, this is a case that is as fundamental as it gets. A journalist was penalised for performing his duty. I am here to show solidarity with him.

The National Institute of Virology (NIV) at Pune has sent a team as well. Surveillance begun Surveillance activity has been started in the affected area with the 33 teams of the State government having carried out house-to-house visits in six villages and three hamlets near Kolat, in the Sanand taluka, around 35 km from Ahmedabad, covering a population of more than 26,000 people, said an official statement issued by the Ministry here. From among the 100-odd cases of fever detected, all but two, who are under surveillance, have recovered. Fifty-eight samples have been collected, including from the staff of the hospital in Ahmedabad where three deaths were reported. Forty-five of them have already tested negative at the NIV. The State Animal Husbandry Department is conducting surveillance among domesticated animals. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has also surveyed 58 hospitals over the past 15 days for any unusual deaths. But not a single case had been reported for viral hemorrhagic fever. Treatment protocol A detailed treatment protocol for CCHF has been developed at the B.J. Medical College, Ahmedabad, with the help of various experts. Recommendations on prevention and treatment have been obtained from the World Health Organisation and shared with the Central team and the State government. An expert team is also meeting to review the treatment protocol. No cure yet Congo fever, a highly infectious disease which spreads through the aerosol route, has no known treatment as yet. Among animals, it is transmitted through ticks. The virus has been detected in India for the first time with three deaths reported since January 3.  OPEN",

Making this announcement, Chief Minister Mayawati said the Crime Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department, which was probing the rape of the minor girl, also filed its charge sheet in the Banda court. Dismissing the Opposition attack as a conspiracy to defame her government and recounting the action taken in the case, the Chief Minister told a press conference here that she had ordered the arrest of the MLA, Purshottam Naresh Dwivedi, and three others on receipt of the CB-CID's preliminary report. The release of the girl was ordered on January 15 as, according to the CB-CID report, she had been falsely implicated in a theft case and sent to the Banda jail. Besides, Ms. Mayawati said, she directed the Principal Secretary (Home) to ensure the girl's security. Subsequently, Atarra police station (in Banda) Circle Officer Rajendra Yadav, Station House Officer Radhey Shyam Shukla, inspector Abdul Jabbar, Banda ASP Lala Ram and jailor Gyan Prakash were suspended and departmental action was initiated. Assailing the Congress, Ms. Mayawati asked why it was silent on the gang-rapes in Delhi and other atrocities on women in Haryana. Compared to Delhi, the ratio of crime against women was low in Uttar Pradesh. It was during the Congress rule that Phoolan Devi was compelled to take the law into her own hands following the excesses committed by feudal elements. Phoolan Devi, who later became an MP, was killed in Delhi during the NDA rule. Ms. Mayawati asked why the Opposition was silent on the 1995 tandoor case, the 1999 Jessica Lal murder case, the 1990 case of molestation of a 14-year-old girl by the then Haryana Inspector-General, S.P.S. Rathore, and the 1996 Priyadarshini Mattoo case in New Delhi.  OPEN",

The court took serious note of non-compliance of its ruling against black films in vehicles in the light of the case of gang rape in a Delhi bus with its glasses heavily covered by curtains and black film tints. The drive will indefinitely go on until all the car owners conformed to the rule law in the district, said a senior police official. As an initial step, Superintendent of Police M. Ramesh ensured that black films in all the official vehicles in his department were removed in the run up to the drive. The cars with tinted glasses used by senior officials in the district were also no exception from the drive. Cases would be booked against the users of the vehicles, regardless of their official and social position, the officer said. Rule 100 of Motor Vehicle Act 1989 stipulates that Visual Light Transmission (VLT) level should be not more than 50 per cent for the window glasses and 70 per cent for the front and rear windscreens. Fines According to M. Rajani, the city DSP, 66 cases were booked and Rs 1 lakh collected as fine from the violators in the Eluru police sub division on the first day. The raid has been launched at eight places across the district, with a special focus on the Kolkatta-Chennai National Highway and the inter-district entry points on the State and the national highways such as the road-cum-bridge at Kovvuru on the East and West Godavari borders and the toll plaza at Kalaparru on the NH-5 on the Krishna-West Godavari borders.

        "content": " Work is apace at the Defence Research and Development Organisation's Naval Materials Research Laboratory at Ambernath in Maharashtra on developing a land-based prototype plug, and subsequently an engineered, operational version of an Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system that will significantly cut the indiscretion rate' of diesel and electric submarines. The indiscretion rate' is the percentage of time a submarine spends snorting when it is most vulnerable. By eliminating the need for conventional submarines to frequently resurface for recharging batteries by breathing in air, it would considerably enhance their sub-surface endurance. Talking to The Hindu here recently, J. Narayana Das, DRDO's Chief Controller, Research and Development (Naval Systems, Materials and Human Resources), said the Navy was satisfied with the DRDO's proposal. We are first having a land-based demonstrator. And, as we progress, we will concurrently start an engineered version because engineering anything for a submarine platform is a completely different ballgame. (Incidentally, The Hindu has learnt from sources in the Navy that it has asked the DRDO to come up with a fully engineered fuel cell AIP by 2014 for possible use in the last two of the six Scorpene submarines being built in Mumbai's Mazagaon Dock. The Navy has also given sanction for the land-based prototype AIP in August this year.) Asked about the recent offer of French defence major DCNS to install its MESMA AIP in the last two Scorpenes, Mr. Das said he wouldn't want to commit on the platform that would have the indigenous AIP fitted. It depends on which platform will be ready and which will come in then. With the Navy We are working in tandem with the Navy as we don't have any other customer for the project. It will be ready in four to five years from now. The technology development is going on, and at an appropriate time, we will start marinisation and engineering for submarine quality. We are going to have industrial partners with us... Whatever we install will be on an operational submarine, Mr. Das said. Safety ensured Explaining the technologies available for improving the sub-surface endurance of conventional submarines, he said the AIP being developed by the DRDO also ensured a higher level of safety to the submarine. In our technology, we generate hydrogen online on an as-needed basis. If you need more hydrogen when you are going fast, you produce more hydrogen and if you need less hydrogen, you produce less of it. The policy is do not store hydrogen on board,' which ensures a higher level of safety to the platform. Also, we use fuel cells of a different type  phosphoric acid fuel cells  as they can tolerate slightly impure hydrogen. This is because when you produce hydrogen on board, you cannot have very pure hydrogen whereas other companies making fuel cell-based AIP are using PEM (proton exchange membrane) fuel cell, which necessitates hydrogen to be of five-nines' quality, meaning 99.999 percent pure, he said. More hydrogen needed The AIP developed by the DCNS, on the contrary, worked on combustion of fuel using a steam turbine and producing electricity, Mr. Das said. Some other companies are using fuel cells themselves. They keep hydrogen stored on board. But if you want to be underwater for longer durations, you need larger quantities of hydrogen. Oxygen is required, but both systems use oxygen which is stored as [cryogenic] liquid oxygen. And when you talk of a submarine's power system, the hydrogen you need is in the order of a couple of tonnes. Further, it has to be carried either in metal hydrides or in compressed cylinders. But high-pressure hydrogen is a potential explosive hazard.  OPEN",

With no respite from the heavy rains lashing the area, the pilgrims are waiting for food and water. According to some of the relatives of the pilgrims stuck in Uttarkashi, the situation was grave with landslips hampering relief operations. According to information, most of the pilgrims hailed from Nalgonda, East and West Godavari and Krishna districts. It is understood apart from established travel agencies several small-time tour operators started operating pilgrimage to Gangotri and Yamunotri. As a result, the State government did not have the exact numbers. Ms. Erukula Sashanka from Srinagar Colony in the City, as many as 21 of her relatives including parents  E. Chenna Kesava Rao and Roopa Devi, were stranded in Uttarkashi since Saturday night. She told The Hindu on Sunday night that the 21 member group had left Delhi by tourist buses operated by Southern Travel, New Delhi. They had left on June 12 and had visited Gangotri and were returning to Uttarkashi, where they were to stay for the night, when heavy rains disrupted vehicular traffic leading to heavy traffic jam. My parents told me over phone that more than 100 buses were stuck on the road with no rescue operation in sight, she added. Chiru speaks to Uttarakhand CM Union Tourism Minister K. Chiranjeevi, on learning about the plight of the pilgrims, spoke to the Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna and State Tourism Minister Amrutha Rawat urging them to take up rescue operation. Sources said the Uttarakhand officials informed the Tourism Minister that heavy rains continued to lash the area making it difficult to take up relief operations. Relief Commissioner T. Radha told The Hindu that he was trying to contact the District Magistrate of Uttarkashi in a bid to launch rescue operations for the trapped pilgrims but he could not be reached over the phone. Mr. Radha said he came to know about the incident only through TV channels. Meanwhile, the Uttarakhand government has set up a helpline to pass on information about the pilgrims. Its number is 01374226126. Nalgonda Collector N. Muktheswara Rao told The Hindu that initial reports suggested that at least 150-200 pilgrims from Miryalaguda and other nearby areas were on a pilgrimage to Gangotri and Yamunotri.  spoke to Uttarkashi Collector Rajesh Kumar, who said that rescue teams were already on their way, he added.

However, one man was surprised  in fact, shocked  that the system could work so unfairly and unjustly towards the disempowered citizenry. Central Information Commissioner Sailesh Gandhi, who heard the case of Bir Singh at a Right to Information hearing, was so anguished by the farmer's plight that he made this recording on December 30: The Commission realises that this old, barely literate complainant is hurt at the complete callousness of his government. He realises that his younger brother was able to get his plot by corrupt means and waits helplessly  intimidated by the bureaucracy and the government system which takes away his land, and gives him no promise of when he will get the alternative plot. This Commission is unable to help him but hopes that somebody sensitive enough in the government will realise that the poor and disempowered cannot be harassed like this endlessly Mr. Bir Singh, who had knocked on all possible doors to know whether his application for alternative land had been processed, decided finally to take the RTI route. With help from his neighbour Guru Dutt, he filed an application with the Land & Building Department of the Delhi government. He had one query: When would his file be put up for scrutiny before the sub-committee on alternative allotments? The Public Information Officer of the L&B Department said the case did not come under the RTI, but offered to let Mr. Bir Singh inspect his file. But since Mr. Bir Singh was unlettered, he asked whether Mr. Dutt could accompany him for the inspection. The Department refused permission, forcing Mr. Bir Singh to go through the mockery of reading a file he did not understand. He was also made to sign on a blank paper. Mr. Bir Singh related this incident to Mr. Gandhi at the first hearing on December 13. A furious CIC wrote: The Commission condemns such behaviour by government officers who are dealing with poor, barely literate people. Later, Mr. Bir Singh gave Mr. Gandhi a curious nugget of information: his brother, with whom he had jointly owned the surrendered piece of land, had got an alternative plot. Mr. Gandhi immediately understood the reason for the discrepancy. His response: A stinging order with a pointed reference to corruption. Mr. Gandhi told The Hindu: I am frustrated at being unable to help. To me, this is open robbing of a poor man by the state.

The aim was to bring together communities and organisations in support of the demand for free, universal and comprehensive healthcare to people from all sections of society. Discussions at the convention focussed on the Union governments proposed changes in the health policy as drafted in the 12th Five-Year Plan. The Planning Commission in its 12th Five-Year Plans draft chapter on health is suggesting several dangerous moves in the health policy designed to strengthen the unregulated, profit-oriented private health sector and further weaken and decimate the public health system, said Akhila Vasan from JAAK. Flawed models Under the pretext of providing universal access to healthcare, the Centre is pushing two seriously flawed models of healthcare  the managed care model and insurance. Both of these have been found to be ineffective in reducing out-of-pocket expenditure on health, she alleged. Abhay Shukla from Maharashtras Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA) said the country has a public system that has been weakened over the last 60 years by the governments privatisation-friendly policies and an unregulated private sector. We need to have a paradigm shift in how we understand the existing situation by building a people-organised struggle to reclaim public health systems through community accountability and control, he said.

Nearly 2,000 residents of the village had been marooned ever since the existing bridge was washed away in the wake of torrential rains earlier this week. District authorities had deployed two elephants from the State Forest Department to supply the village with essential supplies including food, drinking water and medicines.

He also said that he had submitted a report to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on the breach in an embankment near Champasari village in Darjeeling district which resulted in the need for an emergency evacuation of hundreds. Our priority is to ensure the repair of embankments, he said.

        "content": " Considering the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the country, the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) has launched Uday  an intensive five-year programme to fight the diseases. The initial focus will be on improving outcomes for people with diabetes and high blood pressure. Uday is funded by an unrestricted educational grant to PHFI under multinational pharma company Eli Lillys $30 million global initiative to tackle non-communicable diseases in four countries, including India. The other partners of the programme will be the Population Services International and Project HOPE. Based on the research, report and advocate framework, the programme will demonstrate cost-effective scalable approaches for effective diabetes and high blood pressure management which lead to heart attacks. Through this approach, the programme will focus on sharing results with key stakeholders, including the government and the global health community to encourage adoption of best solutions. In the first phase, the project will be implemented in Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and Sonepat (Haryana) districts with an objective to strengthen diabetes and high blood pressure care capabilities in terms of prevention, detection and effective management. It will cover four lakh people. Diabetes and its complications represent a rapidly expanding public health concern that is expected to affect 552 million people by 2030 with devastating health and economic consequences. Diabetes is no longer a disease of the rich. It affects a large number of lower middle class individuals and the poor and over a long term can impact all organs of the body and is linked to heart attacks, stroke, some cancers and several infections, said Dr. K. Srinath Reddy, president of PHFI. The preliminary data will be collected and analysed after two-and-half years for any possible mid-course correction but the final outcomes would be studied after five years. The programme aims to build awareness through social marketing, health promotion and screening events; improve patient education and self management through community health workers and improving health care providers capacity by developing evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and management of NCDs. In addition, it seeks to improve access to treatment by working closely with the local health care institutions and targeted dissemination of findings to effectively advocate scalable approaches of disease management. Melt Van Der Spuy, managing director of Eli Lilly and Company, India, said the company would support identification of innovative solutions to contribute to this fight against diabetes in India. Brazil, Mexico and South Africa are the other three countries where Eli Lilly funds for tackling NDs. Chronic diseases disproportionately affect the economically disadvantaged, with 80 per cent of all NCD deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries. India is home to over 61 million diabetic patients  an increase from 50.8 million last year. By 2030, Indias diabetes burden is expected to cross the 100 million mark as against 87 million earlier estimated. Indias diabetes burden is second to China, which has 90 million people with diabetes (2011) that will increase to about 130 million by 2030. The recent Lancet survey on the Global Burden of Diseases 2010 has also suggested that NCDs are the biggest risk factors in the world.  OPEN",

The accused was captured. He was paraded in and out of courtrooms for over 1000 days. He was found guilty and sentenced. The sentence was carried out in secrecy. Before the eyebrows get lost in the hairline, this is not a rant against the justice system. Allow me to ride the wave of popular opinion. Allow me to say justice was served. Served past dinner time perhaps, but served it was. And oh boy! DID we rejoice! We cried far and wide of victory and justice. We flooded the airwaves and bandwidths with pats on the back. We congratulated ourselves and our elected representatives on a job well done! Let me tempt your brows no further. My rant is a little oblique. Its this circus of confused patriotism thats really getting my goat. The translation of a democratic process into some mangled sense of moral victory. The mis-construed idea that THIS is leading to an End. That change has arrived and has no travel plans. But mostly, its the undignified gloating of a schoolyard bully. Many might argue it is relief, not gloating. Relief for those directly affected. Some turmeric for the long suffering! I humbly secede. I cannot assume to take anything away from their moment. The pen does not seek to confer sainthood upon the dead (terrorist /condemned?), hes got his comeuppance. It implores the readers to break forth from this cirque de madness and into saner pastures. It pleads the question: should we be broadcasting our exultance over the end of life, regardless of the circumstances precipitating it, with such baseness? Celebrate Life, not death. Keep death hush-hush, under wraps. Sweep it under the carpet. Let it fade into legend and folklore. Let it be one of those myths that we can't be sure we truly buy into, but we prefer it that way. When did sensationalism become the norm? When did we to stray so far from the path that we no longer pause to weigh what merits the carriage of our thoughts, the hotness of our breath and what is unworthy of such wreaths. Celebrate Life. Let death be one of those stories we whisper to kids at night with a blanket over our heads and a torch on our face. And watch their eyes widen with awe. Death is a great leveller. All the great texts, the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Koran preach, Forgive and Forget. Or, do the dead have no claim over the scriptures? Celebrate life. Let death neither mar nor glorify it. Dont let it dilute the Now. Let not its imminence distract. Mans greatness lies in his power of thought.  Blaise Pascal It has been quite a long hop since our ancestors crawled out of the sea and grew legs. We have achieved great things in that time. But unless we break away from this slide of thought, trim this rot of mind, reach out of this quicksand of rehashed conformism, we will have no hope of salvation. Celebrate Life. Let us choose to rejoice over the death of terrorism, when that happens. And not over the dead body of man who was a terrorist. Until then, read a good book. (The salil.timble@ gmail.com)  OPEN",

        "content": " Mohammad Amir Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving gunman of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, was finally hanged to death. He was executed in the utmost secrecy with the knowledge of only a selected team of 17 government officials. And as this most awaited trial came to an end, what lessons do we draw from it? First, considering the long years that simple hit-and-run cases take to reach a logical conclusion in India, this trial proceeded faster than usual. True, it is frustrating that it took four years to punish the terrorist despite his being caught on CCTV butchering innocents, but then it was no usual crime. The courts had to study an 11,000-page charge sheet, hear endless arguments and deal with inconsistent statements. And, finally after a marathon hearing, spanning over two and a half months, the Supreme Court found him guilty of 80 charges, including waging war against India, murder and terrorism, and upheld his death sentence. Within two months, his mercy plea was dismissed and he was hanged at the Yerwada jail in Pune. Although Kasabs death can hardly be called a closure for, the pain suffered by the victims and their families is too great, it will go a long way in instilling the faith in our judicial system. Kasabs hanging is also significant in the light of the fact that there are 11 mercy petitions pending before his plea, some as old as 20 years. The mercy petitions lying with President Pranab Mukherjee include that of Parliament attacker Afzal Guru (was to be hanged in 2006), Rajiv Gandhis assassins Santhan, Murugan and Perarivalan (were to be hanged in 2011) and the former Punjab Chief Minister, Beant Singhs killer Balwant Singh Rajaona (was to be hanged in March, 2012). Back in April, the Supreme Court expressed its anguish at the long delays in disposing of mercy pleas, saying it rendered relief meaningless. Seven months after that court rap, the long queue of mercy pleas raises another big question  when will our governments and leaders give up hypocrisy? Our governments and intellectuals never miss a chance to say terrorism has no religion or colour. A message relayed time and again during bomb blasts or riots. Isnt it duplicity in behaviour that these same governments and intellectuals do exactly the opposite of what they preach by attempting to save criminals or seek clemency for them under the garb of religion? Isnt it sad that in attempts to seek pardon for people like Afzal Guru, a terrorist suddenly acquires a religion and colour? Political parties such as the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir have voiced their support for Afzal Guru, implying that hanging a Kashmiri Muslim would risk peace in the Valley. Last year, the Centres interlocutor on Kashmir, Dileep Padgaonkar, said any decision on Gurus mercy petition should be taken keeping in mind the present situation in the State. It is frustrating that a criminal, guilty of killing eight people, has been turned into a defenceless and harassed minority. Back in 2011, the former President, Pratibha Patil, rejected Khalistani militant Devender Pal Singh Bhullars mercy petition but his death sentence is yet to be carried out. Instead, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, seeking his intervention in getting Bhullar a lease of life. Again, his Sikh status and the possible benefits of vote-bank politics outdid his crime of bombing a car and killing nine people. Similarly, Rajiv Gandhis killers have been saved by pro-LTTE organisations and Tamil politicians. Of course, why legally argue about ones crime when playing politics with religion can do the work? The reason why the law hanged Kasab is not that he is a Pakistani Muslim or that it quenches Indias thirst for revenge. But he knowingly committed a heinous crime and had the blood of 55 innocent lives on his hands. Not once was his religion part of the legal discourse. And this same yardstick has to be applied while judging the crime of every other convict. In the 2002 Gujarat riots case as well, how is the law deciding who deserves punishment? Is it because the culprits are Hindus or because they knowingly, with state support, killed thousands of Muslims? The U.N. defines terrorism as any act intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organisation to do or abstain from doing any act. Judging by the U.N. definition, Afzal and Bhullar are terrorists. Period. Whether they are Muslim or Sikh is immaterial. I hope that our leaders and governments would do a service and not link religion with terrorism whenever it is convenient for them. Secularism, remember, is not custom-made.

        "content": " The warning signs are already out there. Global air and ocean temperatures have risen in response to human-driven emissions, particularly of carbon dioxide. Oceans have become more acidic and the sea level has gone up; the Arctic Sea ice has melted faster than expected; rainfall and snowfall patterns have changed; and extreme weather events seem more frequent than in the past. Such changes, with the associated consequences, are likely to worsen considerably if emissions continue unabated. At the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 2009, the nations of the world pledged to avoid dangerous climate change by reducing emissions. They would ensure that the average global temperature at the end of this century did not exceed that of the pre-industrial period by more than two degrees Celsius. But as emissions continue to soar and with no meaningful global agreement in place to drastically cut them, there is increasingly talk of a temperature rise during this century of four degrees Celsius. A four degrees Celsius world would be one of unprecedented heat waves, severe drought, and major floods in many regions, with serious impacts on ecosystems and associated services, warned a World Bank-sponsored report published last month. India has already seen its average annual surface air temperature rise by about 0.5 degrees Celsius during the past century. The warming had accelerated since 1971 and particularly so during the past decade, according to the countrys Second National Communication to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change made earlier this year. Scientists use climate models, which have grown in sophistication, to simulate the impact that emissions produced by human activity will have on future climate. These models show a further sharp rise in temperatures over India as a result of climate change. An analysis of the output from 18 different global climate models, published recently by scientists from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, and the IIT-Bombay, indicated that the countrys average annual surface air temperature could go up by between four degrees Celsius and seven degrees Celsius by the end of this century at the current rate of emissions. Such large temperature increases would be detrimental to society and the countrys economy, said K. Krishna Kumar of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune. In such a scenario, the frequency and duration of heat waves was likely to increase substantially, taking a toll on human health. Agriculture too would be adversely affected by the rise in temperature. What would happen to rainfall in the face of climate change, especially to the south-west monsoon that provides much of the precipitation the country receives, has proved more problematic to predict. For one thing, nationwide rainfall during the south-west monsoon has not shown any consistent trend over the last 140 years. Instead, the monsoon has displayed alternating periods of above-average and below-average rainfall. Moreover, unlike with temperature, global climate models differ considerably in depicting how the monsoon will react to rising emissions. The combined output from the ensemble of 18 climate models studied by Indian scientists suggested that the monsoon might give 20 per cent more rain by the end of this century if emissions continued at the current rate. Research published by B.N. Goswami of the IITM and other scientists showed that there had been a shift in rainfall patterns over central India in the latter half of the last century, with more heavy rainfall events and less moderate rain occurring. Several studies based on various climate models have given indications that episodes of heavy rain, along with fewer rainy days, could become frequent in large parts of the country later this century, said G. Bala of the Indian Institute of Science. Consequently, the country could face more floods and droughts as the climate continued to warm. A warming of the global surface temperature by four degrees Celsius could lead to an associated sea level rise of 0.5 metre to one metre, noted the World Bank report. Many coastal areas in the country were vulnerable to rising sea levels as were the deltas of the Ganges, the Krishna, the Godavari, the Cauvery and the Mahanadi, according to Indias Second National Communication. Besides, higher sea levels increase the damage a cyclone can unleash as it sweeps ashore. Cyclones and storm surges could have a devastating impact on large urban centres, including the mega cities of Mumbai and Chennai, as well as other coastal cities, the Second National Communication observed. Although higher carbon dioxide levels and more rain can help crops grow better, higher temperatures and more erratic rainfall are often detrimental. For instance, the countrys wheat production could fall by about four million tonnes for every one degree Celsius rise in temperature during the crops growth period. Climate change, along with other environmental stresses, poses significant challenges for cereal production in China and India, according to a recent report from the U.S. National Intelligence Council. Climate change will bring along it with new problems and challenges that must be faced.  Indias average annual surface air temperature may go up by between four degrees Celsius and seven degrees Celsius by the end of this century  An analysis of the output from 18 different global climate models indicates that Indias average annual surface air temperature could go up by between four degrees Celsius and seven degrees Celsius by the end of this century.

        "content": " The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) times the release of its provisional annual statement with the U.N. climate negotiations. This year, it dwelt on the Atlantic Basin experiencing an above-average hurricane season for a third consecutive year, with 19 storms, 10 of them achieving hurricane status, the most notable being Sandy. East Asia was severely impacted by powerful typhoons, with Sanba being the strongest in 2012, causing destruction in parts of the Philippines, Japan, and the Korean peninsula. The years 20012011 were all among the warmest on record and the WMOs statement highlighted the unprecedented melting of the Arctic Sea ice and multiple weather and climate extremes. The WMOs statement fell on deaf ears at the Doha climate talks. As 194 countries dragged on with negotiations, typhoon Bhopa was wrecking the eastern part of the Philippines. A new policy paper by Nicholas Stern and others from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, says the overall pace of change is recklessly slow. We are acting as if change is too difficult and costly and delay is not a problem. Almost endorsing this, there was a distinct lack of urgency at the Doha talks. Inside meeting rooms, negotiators and developing countries battled to hold on to what the climate talks had delivered in the last 20 years or so. But the ground was slipping away fast. And at the end of it, the basic principles of equity and responsibility for historical emissions were threatened. The U.S., along with Japan, objected to the equity principle under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and also to equity being the basis of future negotiations. While the Durban platform clung on to the principles of equity as enshrined under the UNFCCC, the U.S. made it clear that it was not going to accept it. The climate talks have delivered less and less since Bali where the two-track approach was mainly geared to bringing on board the U.S, which is not part of the Kyoto Protocol. Finances, adaptation, mitigation and technology transfer were the key issues under the Bali Roadmap. India, part of the G-77 group, plus China had to object vociferously to the removal of the key pillars of the talks from the Long-term Cooperative Action plan. A Philippine delegate quipped that this was meant to be a paperless conference, not a textless one. In the end after a days delay, the Doha Climate Gateway kept the multilateral process alive but gave little in terms of finance or ambitious emission cuts. India, not too happy with the results, managed, along with G-77 plus China, to ensure that equity was the mainstay. The head of the Indian delegation, Mira Mehrishi, reiterated Indias firm commitment to the principles of equity and the need for adequate funding for the developing countries to address climate change impacts. She said the notion of equity was rooted in historical responsibility. While the U.S. has been consistently opposed to this, its climate envoy Todd Stern, in a sudden U-turn, spoke fondly of equity in an address to the high-level segment. As talks ended, it was evident that Mr. Sterns idea of equity and common, but differentiated, responsibility was different from the rest of the world. China stress on funds Finance is the core issue, as Chinese delegation head Xie Zhenua kept emphasising during the talks. But the Doha Gateway only urges the developed countries to scale up finance to reach $100 billion a year by 2020 and submit plans by the next round of talks in Poland. There also seems to be a complete lack of ambition in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, which is now eight years. Sunita Narain, director-general of the Centre for Science and Environment, adds: Doha failed because the world agreed not to raise its level of ambition. It was agreed in Bali in 2007 that the industrialised world needed to cut 45 per cent below the 1990 levels by 2020 to facilitate a temperature increase cap of 1.5-2 C which is considered as safe levels. The issue of carrying forward surplus emissions was strongly objected to by Russia, which was unhappy with the proposal under the Kyoto Protocol to cramp the carry-over of carbon credits or surplus allowances which it had accumulated during the Protocols first commitment period. Money supply for the Adaptation Fund suffered due to the decline in the market prices of certified emission reduction, and as a result, $301.1 million was collected. With funds dwindling, countries lobbied for a mechanism on loss and damage since Cancun which finally was agreed upon at Doha. Crumbs are doled out as global temperatures rise and the poorest countries face disaster.  The climate talks have delivered less and less since the Bali conference  OPEN",

        "content": " The State government has urged the Centre to take concrete measures for the inclusion of Kerala's demand for a peninsular railway zone in the coming railway budget. Minister M. Vijayakumar, who is holding charge of Railways in the State, told presspersons here on Friday that a memorandum, with Kerala's demand for the development of railway facilities, had been submitted to the Union Ministry of Railways for immediate consideration. Mr. Vijayakumar said the peninsular railway zone was a project assured to Kerala by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself during the formation of the Salem Railway Division. The project was still remaining ignored. The Centre, which cold-shouldered Kerala's demand for a separate railway zone, had been benevolent in sanctioning nine other new railway zones all over the country instantly. Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee was not even willing to listen to the demands of Kerala, he said. She did not even let Kerala delegates to discuss the State's rail development issues with her. The State was still awaiting permission to meet her directly and convey the people's requirements. Alleging laxity on the part of railway officials in cooperating with the State governments' rail development initiatives, Mr. Vijayakumar said the officials were misbehaving with the silent consent of the Ministers concerned. The officials had even gone to the extent of skipping a meeting which was recently convened by MPs in Thiruvananthapuram to discuss the State's rail development issues. He alleged that he was not informed of the flagging-off ceremony of the Ernakulam-Lokmanya Tilak Biweekly Duronto Express on Friday. He clarified that the State was keen on providing the required land for various railway development activities in the State. The propagandas going round are meant to cover up the slipups of the Centre, he said.  OPEN",

        "content": " : Indian National League (INL) leader P.M.A. Salam, MLA, said here on Friday that his removal from the post of party State general secretary by the party leadership was against the constitution of the party and therefore null-and-void. Addressing a press meet, Mr. Salam said the decision was completely undemocratic and not binding as it was against the constitution of the party. INL State president S.A. Puthiyavalappil on Tuesday had announced the removal of Mr. Salam from the party post for allegedly advocating merger of the INL with the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). Mr. Salam said the party's national general secretary Siraj Ibrahim Sait also shared his view about his removal from the party post. He asked the party State president to immediately convene the party's State council meeting, which was long due, to sort out the issue and find a way out for the differences of opinion prevailing in the party. Mr. Salam said it was the State president (S.A. Puthiyavalappil) himself who had initially advocated the merger of the party with the IUML during the State Council of the party at Thalassery on June 4 last. Hence he should be ousted first, he said.   OPEN",

Nagar Madishetty Ravinder, who was accused of helping a history-sheeter to illegally occupy the house of an octogenarian -- who was eventually murdered in March this year -- using fake documents while working at Chikkadpally two years ago, was arrested on Monday. The house owner, A.S. Ram Prasad, 87, was allegedly killed by Sandeep Chaudhary, who has a history sheet in Humayunnagar police station, and his aide Pavan. The senior citizen, who had retired from the State-run RTC, had no children. After his wifes death, he was living in the house spread over 500 square yards at Jawaharnagar in Chikkadpally. On learning that the elderly person wanted to sell his house, Chaudhary met him on the premise of buying it. Chaudhary and Pavan went to the old mans house several times and allegedly stole his cheque books. With forged signatures, they withdrew nearly Rs.10 lakh from three of his bank accounts, the Central Crime Station sleuths probing the case said. The senior citizen suspected their complicity and warned them that he would sound the police if they failed to return his money. Chaudhary agreed to return the money. Prasad, however, failed to notice that the duo also stole link documents of his house, a police official said. Making use of these papers, they approached Mr. Ravinder, who was then working as Chikkadpally Sub-Registrar in January 2010. They told him that they were buying the house but the owner cannot come to the Sub-Registrar office as he was bed-ridden. Accordingly, an attender was sent there. Chaudhary and Pavan ensured that the retired man fell asleep by allegedly giving him tea laced with sedatives. They paid Rs. 25,000 bribe to the attender and got the documents signed by Chaudharys friend Shiva in the place of house owner, the police said. When the signatures didnt tally, the Sub-Registrar didnt release the registered documents. Meanwhile, Prasad himself went to the Sub-Registrars office and got the house registered in his brother-in-laws name. Relevant documents were also issued. Getting wind of this, Chaudhary and Pavan allegedly smothered Prasad in his house on the intervening night of March 6-7. Later, they ensured that the house was registered in their names by paying Rs.7 lakh to the Sub-Registrar. They later took possession of the house. Police officials said Ravinder was arrested for helping Chaudhary and Pavan to occupy the house, after it was registered in the name of the relative of Prasad. Meanwhile, the murder case is also being investigated into, but no arrests have been made so far.  OPEN",

At a press conference here on Monday, a group of party leaders, led by the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee executive committee member M.C. Jose, blamed the DCC general secretary K. Neelakandan and the KPCC executive committee member from Kannur M. Narayanan Kutty for the incident. The leaders alleged that Mr. Neelakandan had instigated the workers to create a chaotic scene.

Reports said the registration details of 20,000 new members and important documents kept in the office cabin were missing from the office. The party leaders alleged that a group of people, led by Naushad Vazhavalappu of the Kalliassery unit of the Youth Congress, reached the office after 5 p.m. to receive the membership forms. As the returning officer said the office had been closed by that time, they forcibly entered Jawahar Bhavan in protest. A police team dispersed the feuding activists. The leaders urged the State party leadership to suspend those involved in fomenting a rift among the workers. The indiscipline of this nature will mar the hard work of Youth Congress workers in helping the party enrol ,20,000 members in the past few months, Mr. Jose said.

A Bench of Justices H.L. Dattu and C.K. Prasad directed the Madras High Court to dispose of afresh the writ petition filed by the former DMK MP, Kuppusamy, after taking into consideration the reports of the Returning Officers of Bhuvanagiri and Pudukottai expeditiously, preferably in four months. It quashed the proceedings already initiated by the EC pursuant to the High Courts directions. The Returning Officers maintained that Ms. Jayalalithaa had not suppressed anything as she had indirectly accepted her filing of papers in two other constituencies  Krishnagiri and Andipatti  and the necessity of taking action for giving a false declaration did not arise. All four nominations were rejected as she was disqualified to contest the polls at that time following her conviction in the TANSI land deal case. Filing nominations in more than two constituencies is an electoral offence. As the Returning Officers did not take action against Ms. Jayalalithaa when complaints were filed, Mr. Kuppusamy filed a writ petition in the High Court, which in June 2007 directed the EC to register criminal cases against her. The High Court held that Ms. Jayalalithaas declaration in the third (Bhuvanagiri) and fourth (Pudukottai) constituencies that she had not been nominated from more than two segments was false to her own knowledge and amounts to violation of Section 33(7) (b) of the Representation of the People Act [under this provision a candidate cannot contest from more than two constituencies]. Ms. Jayalalithaa challenged the High Court order and the Supreme Court in July 2007 stayed all further proceedings in these cases. The EC, in its response, said if a candidate filed four nominations, the third and fourth were not maintainable under Section 33 (7) of the Act and prima facie it appeared that this provision had been violated. It acted as per the directions of the High Court.   OPEN",

Frankly, the officer concluded, Im not sure if he fully understood exactly what was going on. Its also possible hed ceased to care. Sources in the Maharashtra Police, who had dealt with Kasab, said this was of a piece with his conduct over the past two years at Mumbais Arthur Road Jail, where he had almost no communication with prison staff. Guards stationed outside Kasabs cell, the sources said, had strict instructions not to engage with him in anything but functional conversation.

We try to look after all prisoners as best we can, the prison official added, but if anyone thinks were holding biryani parties, they know what they have to do to find out firsthand.

The final walk to the gallows in the jail is about 20 feet, and was covered in a minute, the sources said. Around 10 people, including Jail Superintendent Yogesh Desai, a medical officer from the government-run Sassoon Hospital and an executive magistrate were present for the hanging. Preparations, including the testing of the strength of the rope and mock hangings, were made a week before. Mr. Desai told The Hindu that there was no designated hangman and a jail staffer covered Kasabs head with a customary black hood, then put and tightened the noose around his neck before pulling the lever, making the platform below give away. As per the process, the body was left hanging for half-an-hour, after which the medical officer declared him dead. He was buried before noon. Official sources said X, the codename, was set in motion on November 12, after President Pranab Mukherjee turned down Kasabs mercy petition on November 5. Even within the State machinery, very few people knew about the operation, right from setting the date for the execution to bringing Kasab to Pune. It was reportedly overseen by Special Inspector-General (Law and Order) Deven Bharti and 16 handpicked officers, including Joint commissioner of Mumbai Police (Crime) Himanshu Roy and Inspector-General (Prisons) Meeran Chaddha Borwankar. Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde signed the file and the communication reached the State government by November 8. The process was set in motion soon after. Except Mr. Bhartis cell phone, the devices of the other 16 officers were switched off, a top official told The Hindu . Kasab was shifted from Mumbais Arthur Road Jail to Pune on November 19. Officials said he was taken on a special flight late at night and whisked off to the Yerwada jail. He was escorted by senior officers of the Crime Branch, commandos of the Quick Response Team and officers of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. The team reached the jail in the early hours of Monday morning, said the official. Few jail officials were aware of the identity of the prisoner. Maharashtra Home Minister R.R. Patil said the date for execution was fixed by the State government on September 11 itself. The jail manual was read out to him [Kasab] in Hindi and Urdu [and he was asked] whether he had any statement or will to make. The last hanging took place in the State 17 years ago: Amrutlal Joshi was hanged on August 26, 1995 for murdering three members of the Sadarangani family in Mumbais Khar suburb. Maharashtras last designated hangman Arjun Jadhav had conducted the execution. Mr. Jadhav, who retired in 1996, had expressed the desire to hang Kasab. However, he died in September this year, aged 77. Yerwada is one of the two jails in Maharashtra  the other being Nagpur Central Jail  which houses facilities for hanging. Owing to the shorter distance from Mumbai, and the extreme security and secrecy involved, it was decided to execute Kasab in Pune, a top official said.  OPEN",

Fifteen minutes later, a terse phone call conveyed to the Maharashtra Home Department that Operation X was successfully completed. Police sources said Kasab was buried on the jail premises. The execution comes five days before the fourth anniversary of the attacks that began on November 26, 2008, lasting nearly three days. The events that unfolded before the hanging were kept a secret too. Jail officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kasab had offered prayers ( Namaz ) before he was brought to the gallows. The final walk to the gallows in the jail is about 20 feet, and was covered in a minute, the sources said. Kasab asked whether his family was informed. However, he did not state any last wish. He seemed very nervous. But he remained quiet before he was taken out from his cell for the hanging, an official said.

The only terrorist to be caught alive, out of the 10 men who attacked the city on November 26, 2008, Kasab was sentenced to death by the special court on May 6, 2011, after a trial that lasted for more than 14 months.

Some questions need to be urgently addressed: What is the legal regulatory framework under which private security agencies operate? What are the parameters/norms that are considered for issue of firearm/weapon licences to private security personnel? What are the guidelines, if any, governing the use of firearms/weapons by them; if not, is it necessary to frame definite parameters? What are the rights and duties of private agencies under the law, particularly, vis a vis the criminal law of the land?

Governor M. K. Narayanan administered the oath of office and secrecy to 13 Ministers who included five existing Ministers at a ceremony in Raj Bhavan. According to political observers here, the reshuffle has been effected with an eye on the upcoming rural elections in the State with the Trinamool Congress government bringing in new faces elected predominantly from the rural constituencies. While six of the new Ministers are Trinamool MLAs, two former Congress MLAs who recently joined Trinamool were also inducted into the Council of Ministers. One was made a Cabinet Minister and given charge of the Tourism portfolio; the other was made a Minister of State (MoS) for Animal Resource Development. A number of slots in the Council of Ministers had fallen vacant after six Congress Ministers resigned on September 22 following withdrawal of Trinamool support to the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre. Four MoS with independent charge  Madan Mitra, Arup Biswas, Subrata Saha, Manjul Krishna Thakur  are upgraded to the rank of Cabinet Minister while MoS for Health and Family Welfare Chandrima Bhattacharya has been given additional responsibility as MoS (independent charge) of the Department of Law & Judicial Affairs.

The former Idukki district secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was arrested from his house at Kunjithanny, near here, at 5.45 in the morning on Wednesday in connection with a case related to the murder of Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC)activist Anchery Baby in 1982. Hundreds of policemen had been deployed in the area to prevent any untoward incidentsin connection with the arrest. Mr. Mani was later produced before the First Class Judicial Magistrate Court at Nedumkandam and remanded in custody till December 4. He was later taken to the sub-jail at Peerumade. The case was registered against Mr. Mani after the media reported his speech at a party function near Thodupuzha on May 26 this year. He is reported to have said that the CPI(M) had made a hit list of 13 persons in the Eighties and that three of them, including Baby, had been eliminated. A Special Investigation Team (SIT), led by Inspector General of Police, Ernakulam range, K. Padmakumar, has since been reinvestigating the political murders in Idukki in the 1980s, including those mentioned by Mr. Mani in his speech. All the accused in the Baby murder case had been acquitted by court for want of evidence. The SIT had given Mr. Mani time till Wednesday to undergo a lie-detection test, which he had objected to. A police team, led by four Deputy Superintendents of Police (Dy.SPs), arrested him. Kattappana Dy.SP K.M. Jijimon told The Hindu that Mr. Mani fully cooperated with the arrest. Baby murder Anchery Baby, who was Udumbanchola block secretary of the INTUC, was shot dead on November 13, 1982. The others mentioned in Mr. Manis speech were Mullanchira Mathai, Muttukad Nanappan, and Balu of Peerumade. After the SIT filed a case against Mr. Mani and the High Court rejected his petition against further investigation in the case, he was removed from the post of CPI(M) district secretary. The case against Mr. Mani was registered under Sections 120 (b) (murder conspiracy) and 118 (concealing the design to commit the crime) of the Indian Penal Code. Police sources said that Mr. Mani was asked to undergo a lie-detection test as there were contradictions in the statements given by CPI(M) district committee member A.K. Damodaran, another accused in the case, and Mr. Mani. The CPI (M) has called for a hartal in the district on Thursday in protest against the arrest.  OPEN",

Three persons have been arrested, while the others, including the PMK functionary, fled the spot. In a complaint lodged with the Shoolagiri Police, the revenue inspector, P.

They spotted one of the tractors on an agriculture field and immediately informed the Shoolagiri police station. Mr. Ramamurthy alleged that before the arrival of the police, the gang led by the PMK functionary rushed towards him and used abusive language. One of the gang members punched the RI in the face. Immediately, the sand was unloaded and the tractor driven towards the officials. He and the others managed to escape from coming under the tractor, Mr. Ramamurthy said.

Veerappa Moily met the agency's Director on Friday to discuss the possibilities of making further progress. I had invited CBI Director A.P. Singh for a thorough discussion on the Aarushi Talwar murder case. The question is whether it is a fit case for closure or further progress can be made, Mr. Moily told journalists here after the meeting. Refusing to go into the options available for the agency, Mr. Moily said he discussed the legal parameters involved in the case. Let us see how we go forward. He defended the CBI, saying no one could question the way it had handled the case. They have done a thorough job with utmost sincerity. On Wednesday, the CBI filed a closure report, saying that there was no evidence available at the crime scene to pursue the probe. It was impossible to reach any plausible conclusion because of the lack of concrete forensic evidence to nail the culprits. In a related development, Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, answering journalists, said she was worried by the recent developments in the Aarushi case and wanted the victim to get justice. This is an important issue. We are worried about it. That a child was murdered and why she is not getting justice. We should think seriously. Terming the CBI filing closure report saddening, the National Commission for Women shot off letters to the Home Minister and the Law Minister, seeking a relook into the case. Commission chairperson Girija Vyas said she would request the Prime Minister to look into the matter and take necessary steps. India today has advanced greatly in science and technology, and it will be unfortunate if the CBI, the premier investigating agency of the country, expresses its helplessness to find and nail down those involved in a murder as gruesome as Aarushi's.

According to them, the forest officials should lay a cage trap to catch the panther and the animal should then be taken to the deep forest. The panther first killed a four-month-old female calf on the farm premises owned by Rathu Gounder, adjoining the Anamalai reserve forest area, on the early hours of Thursday and then a dog as well as some country fowls in the evening. The affected farmers pointed out that losing heifers and country fowls to the panther would be affecting their livelihood opportunities considerably. Moreover, panic gripped the people in the hamlets adjoining the check post, which is about 15 km from Udumalpet town, since there were possibilities of the panther coming back in search of food, they said. The residents moved away only after District Forest Officer K. Rajkumar, who arrived on the scene, assured them that every step would be taken to prevent any more panther attacks in the area. Mr. Rajkumar later told The Hindu that two patrol teams had been mobilised to guard the people and livestock in the fringe villages close to the Anamalai forest from panther attack. The pug marks near the body of calf, which was found dead on Thursday morning, confirmed that the intruder' is a panther, he said. Forest Department sources said that a female panther and her cub were located in the adjoining forest during routine patrol some days back, but it is yet to be ascertained whether the same strayed into the village.

Last night [on Monday night] he had posted on Facebook about the Durga Nagpal case and how it would backfire for the State, Mr. Moggalan said. Serious charges Mr. Bharti has been charged under Sections 153/295 A of the IPC, which deal with provocation with intent to cause riot and deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. Other reasons Mr. Moggalan, however, believes the arrest could be motivated by the fact that his father is known for his critical stance against the SP and SP MLA from Rampur, Azam Khan, through his writings. Slams govt. In his Facebook status, posted at 9.57 p.m. on Monday, Mr. Bharti said the Akhilesh Yadav government had totally failed on the recent UPPSC reservation and the Durga Shakti Nagpal issues.

Chidambaram demanding action against policemen for not taking any action against Bahujan Samaj Party MLA Purshottam Narain Dwivedi who has been accused of raping a teenaged girl along with accomplices. Instead, the police have arrested the victim on theft charges based on a complaint by Mr. Dwivedi. I have written to the Home Minister seeking action against the policemen who acted on the complaint of an influential person and chose to arrest the girl on charges of theft, which are yet to be proven, she told The Hindu here. Fearing for the victim's security, Ms. Tirath said she wanted to bring the girl to Delhi and keep her at a Nari Niketan. The Minister will also recommend the trial of the case in a fast-track court. There is absolute goonda raj in Uttar Pradesh, she said. For this, her Ministry will approach either the National Commission for Women (NCW) or the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), depending on the victim's exact age, to pursue the matter and seek her custody. The victim and her family can be pressurised to withdraw the case, Ms. Tirath said, adding that she had no faith in the Uttar Pradesh government. Justice needs to be delivered to the girl, the Minister said. Being a Dalit herself, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati should have taken cognisance of the case. Instead, she took action against the MLA after many days, and that too after public outrage, Ms. Tirath said, adding that she did not wish to politicise the issue. But mere arrest is not enough. He has to be punished also. Ms. Tirath has also forwarded the NCW report into the incident, which has recommended an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation. On charges of theft on the victim, Ms. Tirath said the money recovered from her could have been placed on her by the policemen. We have given the police a total free hand, and there is no accountability. We need to make them accountable for their actions and deeds.

        "content": " The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has come to the rescue of the family of a poor rickshaw puller, fighting for ex-gratia payment for the past seven years, by overruling the contention of the Jammu & Kashmir Government which questioned its jurisdiction. It has directed the State Government to pay Rs.5 lakh to Mohan Lal's bereaved family and send the proof of payment within six weeks. It made clear that its recommendations did not interfere with any of the heads of legislation relating to the State. Mohan Lal was picked up by the Jammu Police on June 21, 2003, from Amritsar in connection with some burglaries. He was taken to Jammu, where he underwent third-degree torture. He died in the District Police Lines Hospital on July 2. Asian Centre for Human Rights director Suhas Chakma brought the issue to the notice of the NHRC. Though the NHRC ordered payment of compensation as early as August 19, 2009, the State Government dragged the issue over the question of jurisdiction. The State argued that the Commission had failed to release the statutory limitation in exercising its jurisdiction in the case. Section (2) of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, specifically excluded the operation of the Act in Jammu & Kashmir in so far as it pertained to matters relatable to the entries enumerated in List II of the VII Schedule of the Constitution. Entry of List II relates to public law and order, and Entry 2 of List II relates to police in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Therefore, Mohan Lal's case was squarely covered under the two Entries in List II as the alleged atrocities were attributed to the Jammu & Kashmir police and, therefore, the NHRC had no jurisdiction in the matter, the Government said. But the Commission observed that List II of the Seventh Schedule contained the heads of legislation in respect of which the State Legislature could make legislation. Entry 2 of List II, of course, related to police (including railway and village police) subject to the provisions of Entry 2A of List I. It only indicated that the State could make any legislationin respect of police  regarding their pay and allowances, rank or any matter relating to the discharge of the duty of the police under the Police Act, if any. Entry 1 of List II related to public order (but not including the use of any Naval, Military or Air force, or any other Armed force of the Union or any other force subject to the control of the Union or of any contingent or unit thereof in aid of the civil power). Of course under these the State can make legislation to regulate public order or anything relating to it. The NHRC order did not pertain to violation of human rights, if any, arising out of any legislation made by the State in respect of any of the Entries in List II. In the case of alleged atrocities on Mohan Lal by the Jammu Police, there was no case registered against him, and killing him was not in discharge of maintaining any public order. Nor was it part of any investigation. It was a clear case of the police torturing a person and killing him in the process. Therefore, the case did not come under any of the powers of legislation of the State Legislature in respect of any of the Entries mentioned in List II of the State List. The jurisdiction of the NHRC has been excluded in respect of the subjects mentioned in List II of the Seventh Schedule. The impugned order does not interfere with any of the heads of legislation, the NHRC ruled, and ordered for compliance of its order on payment.

        "content": " Many residents of Shankarnagar in Amberpet erupted in anger after a local Upener Chary was killed by a milkman of the same locality and his associates three days ago. Condemning the brutal murder committed during daytime, several persons urged the police to immediately arrest the accused. Some even shouted that persons who claimed Charys life should meet same fate. A few hours later when the police shifted the body to morgue and requested some of the locals to be panch witnesses before conducting the autopsy, no one turned up. With much difficulty, the investigating officer completed the formalities. This is not the first instance of police struggling to find a person to help fulfil legal formalities let alone to depose evidence in the court of law against the accused. Investigators experienced this many a time and have a long list of such cases in which no one comes forward to give information and state the same in the court. Why does this happen frequently? Interestingly, both the police and the public have different answers. Charys case is a classic example of the persons, who demanded that the killers be punished, are indirectly helping the accused escape the law by denying even to be a panch witness, aver the police. One of the main reasons for poor conviction rate, especially in homicide cases, is people not willing to state in the court of law what they had seen during commission of an offence or at the crime scene, investigators argue. But are the police really ensuring that interests of a witness are protected and the person is not to put to difficulty from the stage of investigation to trial of the case, ask many. In the name of trial of case, witnesses are forced to come to courts repeatedly. Can the police explain in how many cases they ensured a witness could complete deposition of evidence with minimum number of appearances in the court, is another question no policeman is ready to answer. People fear persons involved in murder cases and would not want to take risk. To alleviate fears of the public, some lawyers say, the police need to rework their strategies and evolve a system protecting the witnesses, ensuring their safety and speedy disposal of cases.

Delivering the fourth Justice Krishna Iyer lecture, organised by the Sarada Krishna Satgamaya Foundation for Law and Justice, he said children should be informed about their rights under the law. This could be achieved only by creating awareness among them. They should be educated about their rights from preliminary school days. Empowerment This knowledge would empower them to enforce their rights when the need arose. For example, children must be taught to speak out fearlessly in cases of abuse, he said. He added that child protection meant protection against violence, abuse and exploitation. The protection of the rights of a child was therefore a responsibility of adults. Apart from civil, economic, social and cultural rights of children, there was an urgent need to recognise another important right, called Right to Petition. The Right to Petition was a human right and acted as an instrument for enforcing other human rights. He said that the judiciary had not only brought child rights into the main discourse of fundamental rights by Constitutional interpretation, but gone further by ensuring that the courts adopted child- friendly procedures and remained easily and equally accessible to child victims. He also stressed the need for prescribing a uniform age limit for a child. A uniform age of 18 had been recognised at the international level under the Convention on the Rights of Child. He said over 400 million children continued to face sizeable challenge in the country. However, the country had not been able to decide as to who was a child. The fundamental benefits of adopting a uniform definition of a child would be that more children could be brought within the purview of child protection.

Gopinath, Inspector General of Police (Thrissur Range), said at the seminar here on Saturday that stringent measures would be taken in cases of violence against women and children. The home, which should be a shelter, is becoming a trap or a place of torture for women. And the men with whom the women share their lives become the perpetrators of the most horrendous violence against them, he said. The problem had to be addressed with a combination of legal strategies, with public education and support services, he said. Domestic violence was not just about a man assaulting a woman. Nor was it about the domination of one over the other. It was a problem for which the solution existed at home but few ever thought of it, the seminar observed. According to Domestic Violence Act, not only physical abuse but also threats of violence, sexual abuse, verbal or emotional abuse such as insults, ridicule, calling names and humiliation about not having a child or a male child can be termed as violence. Even deprivation from economic or financial resources to which the victim is entitled too comes under the definition of domestic violence, the seminar noted. Effective laws and their enforcement were the starting point to stop the rampant violation of a womans right to be free of all kinds of gender-based violence, be it rape or sexual harassment at the workplace, the speakers noted. Janamaithry Police, Thrissur City, organised the seminar. Police commissioner P. Vijayan, Assistant Police Commissioner, Thrissur City, Chandan Chowdary, Professor of Vimala College Asha P.

Reasons behind the decision are not announced, but sources said the government was flooded with requests seeking permission to keep beacon lights on the top of vehicles. Most of the applicants, including persons holding government offices and senior officers, were using beacon lights without permission all these days and were caught unaware when the traffic police suddenly started the drive. Violation of rules During the inspection, police stumbled upon several violations pertaining to A.P. Motor Vehicle Rule No. 313 which explains the categories of the lights and the persons authorised to use them. Many persons holding the position equal to Cabinet Minister  like Zilla Parishad chairman  were also found using beacon lights on the top of their vehicles. It is surprising that a district Collector, Joint Collector and even district revenue officer also had beacon lights mounted on their vehicles. This is against rules, a police officer said. As per the rules, the beacon lights should be wrapped with black covers when the authorised persons are not travelling in the vehicles. Strangely, drivers of the vehicles were found using the beacon lights when other persons were using them. Many VIPs take pride in having beacon lights mounted on the vehicles because it has the element of preferential treatment and attracts attention of others. Some of them are ignorant about the rule position while others have their own interpretation of the rules. When the Cabinet Minister has the beacon light why cannot I use it since I hold a position of the same rank? a VIP reportedly argued with the police. Checking credentials This involves security risk because anti-social elements might reach places inaccessible otherwise and execute their sabotage plans exploiting the situation, an officer remarked. With the traffic police checking credentials of the persons travelling in vehicles with beacon lights, applications began to pour in seeking relaxation from the rule. Even as the traffic police explained to them that they were not authorised to relax the rule, the State government issued orders asking them to stop the drive temporarily.

It was presided over by D.V. Shylendra Kumar, High Court judge, and A.N. Yellappa Reddy, member. A lot needs to be done and we expect results in the next adalat, Mr. Kumar told the officials after the presentations on solid waste and biomedical waste management, restoration of water bodies, tree planting, and tank rejuvenation. Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer M.N. Ajay Nagbhushan, who holds additional charge of Deputy Commissioner, Mysore, said the Lakshmana Tirtha in Hunsur was safe and unpolluted. No sewage from villages located on its banks was being let into the river. The Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan flagged off recently from here would ensure that 20,000 toilets were built in rural areas of the district by March next. Mysore would be an open-defecation free district by 2015, he claimed. Of the 11 tanks proposed to be rejuvenated in the city, two were being taken up  at a cost of Rs. 2 crore for Kukkarahalli lake and Rs. 3.03 crore for Karanji lake. Mr. Reddy asked Chamarajanagar Deputy Commissioner N. Jayaram to initiate steps to check pollution in the Cauvery. Chikmagalur Deputy Commissioner S.T. Anjan Kumar was told that four important rivers took birth in the district and efforts must be initiated to prevent them from getting polluted. A total of 15,000 hectares of forest land had been encroached in the district, of which 2,247 ha had been cleared, Mr. Kumar said. Hassan Deputy Commissioner K.P. Mohan Raj was told to ensure cleanliness in Belur and Halebid, which were tourism spots.

        "content": " A court here on Saturday took cognisance of the charge sheet filed by the police in the Delhi gang rape case and issued production warrants to summon the five accused from the Tihar Central Jail on Monday to commence pre-trial proceedings. Additional Public Prosecutor Rajiv Mohan told the court that the Delhi Central Forensic Science Laboratorys DNA report indicated that the victims blood samples tallied with the blood stains on the clothes of all the accused. A piece of the victims dress, which one of the accused had burnt, was recovered from the ashes at his instance, and blood stains on it tallied with her blood sample. Metropolitan Magistrate Namrita Aggarwal said that prima facie offences under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 376(2)(g) (gang rape), 377 (unnatural offences), 365 (kidnapping), 394 (causing hurt in committing robbery), 395 (dacoity), 396 (dacoity with murder), 201 (destruction of evidence), 120B (conspiracy), 34 (common intention) and 412 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of the Indian Penal Code were made out against all the accused. On Monday, copies of the charge sheet would be supplied to Ram Singh, Mukesh Singh, Pawan Kumar, Akshay Singh and Vinay Sharma. The committing of the case to the sessions fast-track court would depend on the time taken for scrutiny of documents. The sixth accused is being treated as a juvenile and the investigating officer is expected to appear before a Juvenile Justice Board on Monday afternoon. After filing an electronic copy of the charge sheet in court, Mr. Mohan said statements of the physiotherapy student and her male friend, the DNA report furnished by CFSL, Delhi, and medical records from Safdarjung Hospital supported the charges that the Delhi Police wanted framed against the accused. The girl died due to septicaemia arising from multiple organ failure caused by multiple injuries. The death summary submitted by the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore, was correlated by Safdarjung Hospital, where she had been treated till December 26. Mr. Mohan said the charges of dacoity, dacoity with murder, and causing hurt while committing robbery on December 16 last were supported by the fact that the accused were more than five in number and articles they robbed from the two victims were recovered at their own instance. The charge sheet, which names 80 witnesses and contains a list of 12 items of evidence, was ordered to be kept sealed upon the prosecution request to protect the girls identity. Mr. Mohan later told journalists that the post-mortem report was expected by January 20 and it would reveal the brutality of the crime and the manner in which it was committed. The police were waiting for a report on tooth bites inflicted by the girl on three of the accused while she fought to save herself. The police would take some more time to file the charge sheet against the juvenile accused as the court concerned would first go through the bone ossification test report and related documents to be sure of his age, the prosecutor said. Make public victims details: plea Meanwhile, a man in saffron robes, claiming to be the founder of an organisation for rape victims, moved an application in the same court praying that details of the victim be made public and the copies of the charge sheet be supplied to the media. When Mr. Mohan asked him what his locus was to intervene in the matter, he told the magistrate: I am a citizen of India and the girl who was gang-raped and murdered was a daughter of the nation. Her male friend had appeared on television yesterday [Friday]. So there is nothing to hide now. The prosecutor sought dismissal of the application and informed the court that a case had been lodged against the news channel which aired the interview of the male friend. The police faced embarrassment in court when they pointed out to the magistrate that the most important charge  Section 302  was inadvertently left out on the cover page of the charge sheet. The prosecutor said it was a typographic error but other parts of the charge sheet mentioned the murder charge and he offered to move a fresh application to correct the error. The magistrate said this was not necessary and the charge sheet would be read as a whole.

        "content": " It has been almost two years since the State of Puducherrys Womens Commission has stopped taking cases and, since then, there have been few options for women who have had their rights violated. As a result, several crimes against women go unreported and unsolved, without a suitable platform for them to air their views. Many women are reluctant to file a complaint in the police station, even if it is an all-womens station. The Womens Commission was earlier acting as a mediator between the two to ensure that the womens rights were protected. Now, however, with no chairperson, no members or permanent staff, they have been dysfunctional, since late 2011, according to former chairperson of the Commission S. Kamalini. The State Womens Commission was set up in 2004 and since then they have taken up 2000 cases that include dowry problems, marital problems and harassment. However, since September 2011, the Commission has stopped taking cases. Now, even though it is still open, the government has neither provided salaries to the employees for the past 21 months nor have they taken steps to appoint a new chairperson to the commission. So far, apart from the Member Secretary  a Deputy Director in the Women and Child Department  there are no higher officials in the Commission. Since there is nobody with absolute signing authority in the Commission, they are unable to even take up the most trivial cases. Even the Marriage Registration Department, which was one of the highlights of the Commission, now lies defunct, staff members say. According to the staff, even though they were willing to work and come in to the office on a daily basis to sign their attendance, say they want to provide whatever support they could to the people that come in. However, since there was no signing authority in the Commission, it was not possible for them to take up any cases. Since early 2011, none of them have received salaries despite the Madras High Court issuing a direction to the government to pay the pending wages. In late 2011, the Commission stopped taking cases. However, even now they have been acting as a mediator for around 10 to 15 destitute women and children who receive maintenance from their next of kin. According to an official from the Women and Child Department, the government was currently processing the paperwork to appoint a new chairperson. Till such time that they appointed someone, they would not be able to handle any cases. For persons who are bold enough to approach the women police, there is another problem. For the past three days there has been no inspector in charge of the all-womens police station in the North region. The previous Inspector, S. Anjammal, retired on December 31. So far they have not appointed anyone to take over the post and the station is under the charge of a Sub Inspector. The only woman inspector in the service is now in charge of the Villianur All Womens Police Station. The station in the North deals with womens issues pertaining to those who live in Puducherry town and the surrounding areas. The Villianur station deals with all crimes against women taking place in Villianur and the rural areas. Speaking on the issue, Deputy Inspector General of Police I.D. Shukla said the lack of an inspector was not a major problem, since the station came under the charge of the Superintendent of Police (North). However, the main issue was that they did not have the required personnel. According to Ms. Kamalini, however, the police stations  including the all-womens stations  did not provide an atmosphere where the victims felt comfortable enough to report a crime. With the lack of a Womens Commission as well, several crimes against women were going unreported, she said.  OPEN",

        "content": " The Puducherry governments decision to introduce measures that appeared to curbing students freedom rather than preventing instances of harassment of school girls, evoked criticism from womens rights activists and academicians. Speaking to The Hindu , All-India Democratic Women's Association general secretary Sudha Sundararaman said the decision to make girls wear overcoats and separate boys and girls was a silly response that trivialised the issue at hand. There is invariably a trend to blame the victim, which is totally unacceptable. Politicians tend to keep taking measures that restrict the movement of women, which is a grave injustice to women especially at a time when they are entering all spheres of society, be it education or work. The public space is the domain of both boys and girls, she said. The need of the hour is to ensure that all cases of rape and sexual harassment be dealt with in a swift manner and the culprits be given stringent punishment, she added. Head in-charge of the School of Womens Studies in Pondicherry University Lazarus Samraj said the main problem was that no real experts were consulted before making the decision. Principals and headmasters/mistresses did not have the required expertise to formulate policy. Politicians should make a move to consult people in higher education who have done their research in the relevant fields before coming up with such policy decisions. The move to have separate buses was an extremely negative move. What is needed is to teach children how to mingle with the opposite sex with maturity. Separating boys and girls leads to frustration, which leads to alienation between the sexes and that could give rise to potentially violent reactions, he said. Typically, in co-education schools, students learnt to cope with life and people of the opposite sex better than in schools where boys and girls are separate. It was very common to see a line of boys standing outside a girls school or college. This phenomenon did not happen much outside co-ed schools/colleges, he said. Associate Professor of Psychology in Pondicherry University B. Rangaiah also voiced his concern over the decision. Preventing interaction between sexes was unhealthy and instead of that, it would have been better to re-introduce moral education in schools and colleges. Another thing that was the need of the hour was a sex education for schoolstudents. By creating a healthy atmosphere and a proper understanding of sexual behaviour, the students would be able to understand what was right and what was wrong. With the information available on the internet, most children were aware of their sexuality. However there was still no healthy forum for these children to understand what to do, he said.  OPEN",

A village youth Satish, who sustained injuries while attempting to safeguard the victims, was admitted to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital. Lalgudi police are on the lookout for the accused.  OPEN",

        "content": " Asha Dwivedi, wife of rape accused Bahujan Samaj Party MLA Purshottam Naresh Dwivedi, has come out in defence of her jailed husband, stating that he lacked the physical prowess to indulge in a heinous crime like rape. Ms. Dwivedi said in a written statement that since she is his wife she can say this with conviction. She termed the MLA's arrest a conspiracy by the Opposition parties and threatened to commit suicide if justice was not delivered to her family. She, however, said she had full faith in the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and that justice would be delivered once Ms. Mayawati came to know about the actual facts, and how the conspiracy was hatched by the Opposition parties to defame the government. The MLA from Naraini (Banda district) had said before his arrest that he suffered from diabetes and blood pressure and was ready for medical examination. Reiterating what he said, Ms. Dwivedi, flanked by their son Mayank Dwivedi, said that for the last 18 years her husband suffered from diabetes and blood pressure. In the statement that was recorded in the Banda jail, she said the alleged rape victim did not say anything against the MLA. Talking to journalists at the MLA's official residence here on Thursday, Ms. Dwivedi demanded that a medical examination and DNA test be conducted on her husband. She said the alleged rape victim was not a person of good character. This could be confirmed from the people of Shahbazpur, Harnampur, Lachhapurwa and Khaura Chowki villages [in Banda district], she added.Ms. Dwivedi claimed that the girl's medical examination did not show any evidence of rape and physical assault. She even defended the girl's arrest, saying that person had decamped with the MLA's mobile phone and cash. The girl's arrest in Turra village on December 14 was witnessed by about 500 persons, she said.   OPEN",

We can't allow foreign interference in our affairs and we can't approve of it, said a Bench of Justices D.K. Jain, P. Sathasivam and Aftab Alam, which is hearing the Gujarat riots cases. At the last hearing, amicus curiae Harish Salve drew the court's attention to Ms. Setalvad's letters to the United Nations forum on witness protection. The Bench sought Ms. Setalvad's response. At the resumed hearing, CJP counsel Kamini Jaiswal admitted that two letters were sent to the OHCHR. Justice Jain told counsel: We don't appreciate letters being sent to a foreign country, we can't approve of it. Do you mean to say that we can't give witness protection and they will give protection to witnesses? This shows you have more confidence in that organisation than this court. It is a direct interference in our court proceedings. We can't allow interference in our court proceedings. We can't take guidance from such organisations. When Ms. Jaiswal explained that the letters were sent only by way of intimation, Justice Jain said: Intimation has to be with some purpose. If you send such letters in future, then we will hear the amicus curiae and pass orders without hearing you. All these cases are being monitored by us; we don't like any correspondence of her [Ms. Setalvad] with foreign agencies. However, after Ms. Jaiswal assured the court that Ms. Setalvad would not send any more letter to the OHCHR, the Bench passed an order treating the issue as closed. Mr. Salve submitted the status report, dated January 18, given by SIT Chairman R.K. Raghavan on the nine cases, in which trial is going on. When Mr. Salve said one of the judges who had nearly completed examination of 194 witnesses in the Naroda Patiya case was transferred, the Bench permitted Mr. Raghavan to make a request before the Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court for re-transferring the judge to the same court. The Bench took on record amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran's observations on the SIT's final report on the investigation conducted on Zakia Jaffrey's complaint that Chief Minister Narendra Modi and 62 others had orchestrated the riots. After furnishing a copy of the report to the SIT Chairman, the Bench posted further hearing to March 3 for considering this report.  OPEN",

        "content": " In a televised press interaction on Wednesday in Kirandul, S.R.P. Kalluri, Senior Superintendent of Police, Dantewada, accused international humanitarian organisations Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) of helping the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) and promised to investigate both agencies. Formed in 2004, the CPI (Maoist) is a guerilla organisation committed to overthrowing the Union government through an armed revolution. In footage screened by local cable channels, Mr. Kalluri claimed that MSF and the ICRC were providing Maoists with medical prescriptions and treating Naxalites injured in police ambushes. They come in the name of the poor [but] help the Naxalites, Mr. Kalluri said. According to a transcript provided by a local television channel, he also said he had alerted the State government. However, Director-General of Police Vishwa Ranjan said no such investigation was under way. The ICRC is still in the process of signing an agreement with the government to operate in Chhattisgarh, he said. We are not investigating either organisation for supporting the Maoists, he said, attributing Mr. Kalluri's comments to confusion among the local press. Representatives of both organisations expressed surprise and dismay at Mr. Kalluri's accusations. These allegations, as I understand them, are not true. MSF has worked in Chhattisgarh for quite some time. We are very transparent, and provide medical care to the entire population, said Martin Sloot, who heads the MSF mission in India. We are not a political organisation, we are medical organisation. We believe in the principles of impartiality and neutrality, and that healthcare is a right, Mr. Sloot said, adding that MSF did not allow armed people into its health centres. MSF, or Doctors without Borders, now runs a hospital and mother-and-child healthcare centre in Bijapur district and mobile clinics in Dantewada district. Set up in 1971, MSF operates in conflict zones across the world and won the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize for its role in providing healthcare in crisis situations. In 2006, the Collector of Dantewada levelled similar charges against MSF, but the State government allowed the organisation to continue its work in the region. I am surprised by the comments, said Yahia Alibi, Deputy Regional Head of the ICRC. We do not operate in Dantewada, but are running one primary health centre in Kutru, Bijapur, with the full support of the local administration and the police. Based in Geneva, Switzerland, the ICRC is one of the oldest and best known humanitarian institutions in the world and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1917, 1944 and 1963 for its work in international and internal armed conflict. This is the second major controversy to emerge in the aftermath of one of Mr. Kalluri's press conferences. On July 11 last year, he accused a journalism student, Lingaram Kodopi, of being a member of the Central Committee of the CPI (Maoist). In an emotional press conference held in Delhi, Mr. Kodopi denied the charge and said he had been illegally incarcerated by the police in the past and was finally released on the directions of the Bilaspur High Court. A recent article published in Sanhati.com quotes Mr. Kodopi's aunt, Soni Sori, as saying that Mr. Kalluri had arrested her husband on trumped-up charges and allegedly threatened to arrest her unless she handed over her nephew to the police. Mr. Kalluri was not available for comment. SSP accuses the two organisations of giving Maoists medical prescriptions   OPEN",

        "content": " The Coast Guard has begun a comprehensive enquiry into the killing of a Tamil Nadu fisherman, allegedly by Sri Lankan Navy. It assumes significance in the backdrop of denial by Sri Lankan authorities that its Navy had fired at Indian fishermen. Commandant D. S. Saini, Commanding Officer, Coast Guard Station, Mandapam told The Hindu on Friday that the enquiry would cover all details, including the place of crime, eyewitnesses, exact time of firing, pre and post incidents of firing and others. We have established a close liaison with the State police machinery to collect information about the death of Veerapandian. Follow-up action will be taken based on it. Mr. Saini said that besides a stone, a bullet had been found in the boat in which the fishermen ventured into the sea from Jagathapattinam in Pudukottai district. These would be examined. The fishermen who were with Veerapandian had stated that they were 25 to 30 nautical miles off the coast at the time of the incident. Apparently, the firing site did not fall within Indian territorial waters. Preliminary information had revealed that they did not carry communication equipment, Global Positioning System or other navigational equipment. Besides the alleged firing, it was to be verified if there were rivalries among fishermen. Mr. Saini said that the incident took place around 5 p.m. on Wednesday. Taking the bullet-ridden Veerapandian, the other fishermen reached the shore around 11.30 p.m. They must have sailed at high speed. The duration of the journey suggested that they were not in Indian waters. If they were in Indian waters along the shore, they would have reached the shore much earlier. Citing the presence of Naval and Coast Guard vessels and the State government Coastal Security Group vessels along the IMBL, he said no one would dare kill Indian fishermen in Indian waters. The Commandant said that an offshore patrol vessel (OPV), which had a helicopter on board, had arrived at Palk Bay to join with other patrolling vessels. Intensive patrolling had been ordered. Besides the helicopter surveillance, a Dornier aircraft from Arakkonam in Chennai was also carrying out sorties over Palk Bay and Palk Strait.

The expression should be understood in the light of prevailing norms that is expected from a person. It should be interpreted in the widest possible manner while considering the conduct of a person convicted and sentenced, the Madras High Court has said citing the Supreme Court. The question before a Division Bench comprising Justices D. Murugesan and B. Rajendran was: Whether the conviction and sentence imposed on a bank employee under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (Dishonour of cheque) could be considered to be the conviction and sentence for an offence involving moral turpitude, thereby disentitling him from continuing as a union member and holding the post of its general secretary. M. Lakshmanan, who was the general secretary of the ICICI Bank Employees Union, Chennai, was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000 by the Judicial Magistrate, Alandur, in March this year. The Magistrate found that Mr. Lakshmanan, being a bank employee and knowing the law, had issued cheques to three individuals without maintaining sufficient balance. He had borrowed Rs.10 lakh each from three individuals. The bank union secretary filed a civil suit before the court. It alleged that as the appellant's services had been terminated, he could not be a union member. It also filed applications praying among other things for an interim injunction restraining the appellant from functioning as the union general secretary. A single Judge allowed the applications. Hence, the present appeals. In its judgment dismissing the appeals, the Bench said the appellant had been convicted and sentenced. It did not accept the argument that the criminal court's judgment had been questioned by Mr. Lakshmanan and the sentence had been suspended and thereafter the judgment could not be relied. It said pending appeal alone, the sentence had been suspended and not the conviction. So long as the conviction remained, the judgment could be the basis for granting injunction. That apart, the single Judge had granted the injunction not only on the basis of mere conviction, but also considering other factors. As far as the claim for disqualification of the appellant from being a union member and consequently its general secretary, the Bench said the union had made out a prima facie case and for that reason alone, the single Judge had granted the interim order. That apart it was the bank's specific case that in view of the conviction, the appellant had been dismissed applying the relevant provisions of the Banking Regulation Act. On the given facts of the case, the Bench said it did not find the single Judge's reasoning as arbitrary. It made it clear that whatever the findings rendered in its order would be only for disposal of the appeals. The interim applications and the findings could not be construed as conclusive restricting the right of the parties to canvass their stand in the pending civil suit.

The Warkaris were from Baramatis Kambaleshwar village. Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar visited the injured in the hospitals in Lonand and Jejuri. It is unfortunate that innocent pilgrims lost their lives due to the negligence of the driver. We have tried our level best to make the roads better for the Warkaris every year.

        "content": " As doctor and human rights activist Binayak Sen spends New Year's Day in prison as the only person to be convicted on sedition charges in 2010, it is worth noting that at least five others have also faced the charge over the course of the year. Most of these have been charged for their statements with regard to either the Naxal issue or the Kashmir conflict, according to media watchdog site TheHoot.org. Sedition is a crime dealt with in Section 124 A of the Indian Penal Code, which says that whoever by written or spoken words, or by signs or visible representations attempts or brings into hatred or contempt or attempts or excites disaffection towards the government established by law shall be punishable with life imprisonment. This was one of the charges that Dr. Sen was found guilty of last week. Best known cases Perhaps the best known sedition cases of 2010 are those of activist and writer Arundhati Roy and Hurriyat leader S.A.P. Geelani, both of whom were charged for speeches they made at an October seminar on Kashmir titled Azaadi  the only way. While the government initially decided not to initiate any criminal proceedings against the speeches, a Delhi city court directed the police to respond to the demand for a criminal case made by a group of Kashmiri Pandits, while the Delhi High Court issued a similar notice in response to a PIL. Despite the police reporting that the accused had made no inflammatory speeches, the Metropolitan Magistrate directed the police to file an FIR and submit a report to the Court by January 6, 2011. Bizarre case The most bizarre case may have been that of E. Rati Rao, vice-president of the Karnataka chapter of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, who was issued a sedition notice by the Vijayanagara police for bringing out an in-house bulletin in Kannada called PUCL Karnataka Varthapatra. Not only was the bulletin meant for private circulation, its publication had actually been discontinued in September 2007, three years before the sedition notice was issued. Is the law on sedition being invoked a little too often for a democracy that values free speech? asks TheHoot.org's Free Speech Hub which tracked these sedition cases. In other cases, an environmental activist was charged with sedition for disrupting a government Republic Day function in Salem, Tamil Nadu, by distributing Tamil pamphlets questioning the displacement of lakhs of tribals due to Operation Green Hunt and the non-implementation of a Supreme Court order for the rehabilitation of Chhattisgarh villagers. In Srinagar, a lecturer of a government college was arrested for allegedly setting an examination paper filled with questions related to the recent unrest in the Kashmir Valley. The police termed the question paper anti-Indian and seditious. Sedition is a crime dealt with in Section 124 A of Indian Penal Code   Arundhati Roy, Hurriyat leader S.A.P.

Chidambaram on January 6. In separate letter to leaders of eight political parties that attended the meeting on January 5, 2010, Mr. Chidambaram said the government would like to share Justice Srikrishna Committee's report and elicit their views on the way forward. The Congress, Telugu Desam, Telangana Rashtra Samiti, Praja Rajyam, CPI (M), CPI, BJP and the MIM were the eight recognised parties that received invitation from the Home Minister. The invitation has evoked mixed response from political parties as supporters of separate Telangana describe the meeting as a tactic to evade solution on Telangana. It will not arrive at a consensus since all parties were bound to send representatives from both the regions. This issue has turned interesting as all the major parties, barring the BJP and the TRS, are vertically divided over the separate Telangana issue. Like the TRS, the BJP wants introduction of a Bill in Parliament. PR leaders claimed that it would be difficult for the political parties to react on the report until the contents were known before hand. CPI State secretary K. Narayana urged Mr. Chidambaram to provide a copy or synopsis of the report in advance so that political parties could study them in detail.  OPEN",

Forum convenor Nagam Janardhan Reddy and legislator Pocharam Srinivas Reddy warned the Centre that in case it starts talking about any formula to undo injustice to the region it will be doing at its own peril. Congress will have to pay a heavy price and as the leading party in the region the TDP will show its might, they said. Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, they reacted sharply to the statement of Srikrishna Committee member Prof. Ranbir Singh that there were allegations of poor development in the region. They are not allegations but bare facts. Can any member of the committee show proof of implementation of formulas, GOs and commission reports on Telangana? they asked. Telangana was not just an issue of under-development but it was the issue of self-respect. How can anybody talk about keeping the State intact when there is division within the Government? The fact that Telangana Ministers are appointed in-charges of districts within the region and Seemandhra' Ministers in their regions indicate everything, they noted. The forum will take some hard decisions after January 7, if the committee report went against the region. The TDP leaders also asked TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao to decide whether he wanted to strengthen his party first or to achieve Telangana. Water dispute On Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal draft report, they demanded justice to Telangana, particularly Mahabubnagar district. Less than 140 tmcft water was being utilised in the region now against the allocation of 295 tmcft, though 68.5 per cent catchment area of Krishna in the State was in Telangana. The proportionate allocation would be 540 tmcft as per the previous award, they pointed out.  OPEN",

Addressing the 85{+t}{+h}annual general meeting of the FICCI, which Dr. Singh opened earlier, Ms. Swaraj blamed the differences in the ruling coalition for the delay in pushing through legislation. The BJP, she pointed out, had supported the government on the pension bill and bailed it out when it lacked the number as the Left insisted on a division. In his address earlier, Dr. Singh said some decisions were politically difficult and those opposing them were not well versed in global realities or were constrained by outdated ideologies. Disagreeing with Dr. Singhs remark that excessive pessimism was at the root of the slowdown, Ms. Swaraj argued that a sense of cynicism, which developed in the absence of any initiative on the part of the government, had affected growth. A favourable environment was more important than polices, she said, and the ambience was vitiated by scams that rocked the country every day. In this context, she justified the Oppositions role as the watchdog, urging introspection on the governments part, pointing out that these scams were unearthed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India (CAG), a constitutional body. Alleging that progress of most schemes were tardy, including the Pradhan Mantri Grama Sadhak Yojana, Ms. Swaraj said the government alone was responsible for this. She suggested a roundtable discussion among the government, the Opposition, the industry and watchdogs such as the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Central Vigilance Commission and the CAG to create the necessary environment for growth.

Peoples mindset has to be changed and once that happens, I think lot of things can be remedied, he told reporters here.

By just increasing the strength of judges, we cannot overcome the backlog of cases, there is need for adding facilities as well, he said and added: There are many examples of States where the infrastructure has been strengthened and situation has improved a lot. Secondly, I feel that police investigations have to be thorough. Elaborating further, Justice Kabir said many cases continue to drag on due to the slow pace of police investigation. If we improve the investigations by police and make the mechanisms of out-of-court mutual settlement, we will see a huge improvement, he said.

In line with Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs vision, the Student Police Cadet project is being implemented in 26 government schools of 13 districts in the State, the Chief Minister said. Mr. Gehlot said when the police force was established in 1861, its duties were to maintain the British rule and protect the ruling elite from the common people. However, with the establishment of the Indian Police Service by independent Indias first Home Minister Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel in 1948, the police started contributing to the process of nation building, he said. The Chief Minister honoured 10 officers associated with the Rajasthan Police Academy and several other police training schools. Rajasthan DGP Harish Chandra Meena thanked Mr. Gehlot for making sufficient funds available for the development of the police force.  OPEN",

        "content": " Siddappa Sharanappa Angadi (43), a farmer from a remote village in Gadag district, was shocked when the Central Crime Branch (CCB) police from the city knocked on his door and asked for the keys of the two-wheeler he recently purchased from a city-based student'. Mr. Angadi almost collapsed in disbelief when the police said that the two-wheeler he had purchased had actually been stolen from a posh locality in Bangalore. The police had brought the accused, who had sold the two-wheeler, to Mr. Angadi's house to identify and recover the vehicle. Mr. Angadi lost the money he had paid to purchase the vehicle as the police confiscated the two-wheeler. All in a day According to the statistics available with the State Crime Record Bureau (SCRB) of the Police Department, 13 vehicles are stolen from the city every day. According to the SCRB, 4,600 vehicles were stolen from the city in 2010 as compared to 5,600 vehicles stolen during 2009. At least 75 per cent of the stolen vehicles were two-wheelers and 15 per cent cars. The rest were autorickshaws and other vehicles. Of the 4,600 vehicles stolen during 2010, the police have recovered 2,521 vehicles, an official said. A majority of the stolen vehicles had been parked in parking lots on busy streets, near commercial complexes, temples, eateries and wedding halls. Cases of vehicle theft have also been reported from Kempegowda Bus Stand, Bangalore City Railway station and theatres. In many instances, the stolen vehicles were sold to people in rural areas. Even minors and teenagers are involved in such cases, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East Division) B.N.S. Reddy said. Once a vehicle is stolen, the registration number plate is immediately replaced with a fake number, an officer at the Central Crime Branch (CCB) said. Many stolen vehicles are also modified, which make it difficult for the police to detect these vehicles, he added. Duplicate documents Most of the vehicles stolen from the city are transported to another district or neighbouring States. The chassis number is altered and documents are forged before the vehicle is sold  often to an unsuspecting buyer. Some others dismantle the vehicles and sell the parts individually to second-hand spare parts dealers in Shivajinagar, in the vicinity of Tannery Road and Siddaiah Road in the city, said a police official. Anti-theft system City Police Commissioner Shankar M. Bidari suggested that vehicle owners should install anti-theft systems and high-quality locks. Not finding your vehicle where you had parked it is definitely not a pleasant experience. Vehicles parked in front of houses are also vulnerable, Mr. Bidari said here on Friday. M.T.

Acting on the instructions of Commissioner of Police T. Rajendran, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Adyar) M.C. Sarangan formed a special team to investigate complaints of burglaries in the Thiruvanmiyur, Velachery, Neelankarai, Thoraipakkam and Semancheri areas. The team followed specific clues and arrested Bhoopathy (38), who confessed to having committed the thefts. We suspected the involvement of a gang in the burglary cases it did not appear to be a one-man operation. Bhoopathy used two crowbars to force his way into houses, Mr. Sarangan said. The modus operandi of the suspect was to go around on his bicycle during the day and identify locked houses. He would come back again around midnight and enter the houses after removing the window grills. In some houses, he stole valuables even as the residents were sleeping in air-conditioned rooms. He would remove the gills with such precision that there would hardly be any noise, Mr. Sarangan said. After he was arrested by the J.J. Nagar police in connection with the bicycle theft case in 1996, the accused lived in Tuticorin and Hosur for sometime. The school drop-out led a luxurious life with the booty and had a liking for sun glasses and wrist watches. Besides gold jewellery, cash and electronic gadgets, he would make sure to steal some mosquito repellents and sun glasses, the DCP added.  OPEN",

Achuthanandan, Home Minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy on a writ petition challenging the appointment of Soni Thengamam as State Information Commissioner (SIC). The notice was issued by the Bench comprising Justice C.N. Ramachandran Nair and Justice Bhabani Prasad Ray. The petition was filed by D.B. Binu, general secretary, RTI Kerala Federation. According to him, Mr. Soni was the assistant secretary of the Kollam district committee of the Community Party of India (CPI) when the selection committee consisting of the Chief Minister, Home Minister and the Leader of the Opposition considered his name for the post. That apart, he was not a person of any eminence in public life, or management, journalism, mass media or administration. Therefore, his nomination and appointment went against the eligibility norm as stipulated in the Right to Information Act. He pointed out that when the Governor sent back the recommendation, the Law Secretary had opined that there were no legal impediments in appointing Mr. Soni. The Governor later accepted the recommendation on the basis of the legal opinion given by the Law Secretary. In fact, the committee had not considered afresh the recommendation after the file was returned. He contended that the State government usurped the power of the committee and recommended the name of Mr. Soni. The functions and powers of the selection committee could not be delegated to any officer in the State. Therefore, the action of the Governor in accepting the proposal for appointment of Mr. Soni on the basis of the government's opinion was absolutely illegal and in violation of section 15(3)of the Right to Information Act.  Civil supplies case Justice Antony Dominic on Friday directed the State government to take a decision on the report to be submitted by the Director, Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau, regarding buying of substandard and adulterated commodities by the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation. The judge also asked the government to file a report before the court after taking a decision. The directives were passed on a petition filed by the corporation that sought to finalise the proceedings initiated against those who had supplied substandard and adulterated commodities. The proceedings included blacklisting of the suppliers and also withholding payments due to them. The court was assured last time that the suppliers would be proceeded against when a writ petition filed by a businessman from Kozhikode challenging the decision of the corporation to go in for e-tender came up for hearing. The petition also sought to recover the losses from those who supplied the adulterated commodities.  OPEN",

Earlier, the cadres took out a procession with black flags from Kummarigudem village to the project construction site. It was on the same day in 2005 that the foundation stone for the project was laid by former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy. Addressing a public meeting held on the occasion, the party's district secretary P Ranga Rao lamented that the project construction works failed to make any headway due to the apathy of the government. Once completed the project would provide irrigation cover to nearly four lakh acres mainly in the upland areas of the district, he noted and alleged that the government was neglecting the project while giving top priority to Polavaram project. It showed the step-motherly treatment of the government towards the people of the district, he charged and accused the government of releasing meagre amounts to the project just to benefit the contractors without any concern for the speedy execution of the project. The remaining speakers demanded that the government should sanction adequate funds and ensure expeditious completion of Dummugudem project without any further delay. Former MLA Gummadi Narsaiah, All India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha State secretary K Rangaiah, and others spoke.  OPEN",

        "content": " In an initiative to prevent crimes such as chain snatching and eve-teasing, the S.S. Colony police personnel have hit upon a novel idea. For the last two months, the crime police team are on the move in their sports utility vehicles (SUV) with sirens blaring. Apart from visibility to the public and residents, it sends a signal to the offenders to vacate the spot, police said. Following complaints of chain snatching and eve-teasing, Commissioner of Police P. Balasubramanian and senior officers focussed on providing support to the police personnel at the S.S. Colony station. Apart from petty crimes, grave offences in the jurisdiction posed a challenge to the city police. Though there were many factors to the crimes reported, the senior officers were determined to put an iron hand on the offenders. Additional strength As a first step, the sanctioned strength was provided to the station and next was the shuffle of some personnel and officers at the station. New faces in the crime wing were given the task of not only preventing crimes, but also detecting cases under investigation for a long period, police said. Recently, Petchimuthu Pandian was posted as Assistant Commissioner of Police (Crime-Thilagar Thidal sub-division, under which S.S.Colony station falls), VM. Elangovan, Inspector (Crime-S.S. Colony police station), among others. Surveillance through plainclothesmen in crime-prone pockets helped in identifying the troublesome locations and regular watch at the Central Jail also came in handy. The police solved a house burglary case reported in a doctor's residence in S.S. Colony, it may be recalled, an officer said. In the evenings The new officers in charge of crime decided to be on the move in the evenings (from 5.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. and even beyond) in their SUVs with the siren on. Initially, the public were baffled at the police movement with sirens, but as days passed, it was welcomed by a majority of residents, N. Ramanathan of Jawahar Street said. At least, when someone is in need of police help, the movement of the SUV with revolving beacon light comes in handy, a woman from Nehru Nagar said. Police officers said that crimes do happen, but this is a step to discourage law offenders and in another way helps instil confidence among lone women or old people to move around without any fear. May be extended Mr. Balasubramanian told The Hindu that it was a pro-active step by the S.S. Colony police officers and if necessitated, it would be extended to other areas also. S.S.

        "content": " The sights of speeding vehicles, both four-wheelers and two-wheelers, plying down on the wrong side of the city roads are not uncommon. The problem seems to be that a section of motorists choose to use the wrong lane even on two-way roads in order to enter side streets much to the chagrin of traffic policemen and public. In fact, the widened national highways with flyovers cutting through the city limits has helped the public in no small measure to reach their destinations . Initially, compliance with the one-way norms lessened the burden of traffic police. But the flouting of rules on the service roads by irresponsible motorists along the Tiruchi  Chennai, Tiruchi  Madurai and Tiruchi  Thanjavur highways is now causing a nightmare for the police. All that the erring motorists need to do is to take a detour for a kilometre or two and take the U' turn, to prevent the avoidable risk to their own lives and those of fellow road users. Haphazard parking of vehicles on service lanes is only adding to the problem. For instance, heavy tankers could be found parked on the service road leading to Ponmalai road over bridge from TVS Tollgate and from Mannarpuram junction to TVS Tollgate. Even the vehicles belonging to government departments are no exception. This only shows the laxity on the part of vehicle users, despite the warning boards put up by the NHAI and erection of barricades by the police, a cross section of people say. Karan Singha, IG of Police, Central Zone who is holding additional charge of the City Police Commisioner says he has already instructed the traffic police to check this violation. Flouting of norms is rampant at the flyovers in Palakkarai and Tennur . Those proceeding to Bheemanagar from Palakkarai take a right turn on the Palakkarai flyover, unmindful of the barricades put up by the police. Vehicles taking sudden U' turn at Marakkadai junction and on the Tennur highway to proceed on the Tennur flyover pose a grave danger to the on coming vehicles. Again the people proceeding to Marakkadai from Tennur via the Tennur flyover suddenly take a right turn at the Ramakrishna theatre junction, whenever traffic policeman is not there. It is sad that even educated and senior citizens don't hesitate to jump a signal if a policeman is not manning the junction, police personnel say, calling for an attitudinal change in the motorists. Consumer organisations, voluntary associations, should take a lead in educating people on the dangers of using wrong side, says Like Ali, a retired private sector officer.

A Bench of Justices K.S. Radhakrishnan and Dipak Misra remitted the matter to the High Court, asking it to follow Section 235(2), CrPC, in accordance with the laid-down principles and pass fresh orders on the question of sentence in six months. The Bench, however said, The conviction awarded by the High Court stands confirmed. Writing the judgment, Justice Radhakrishnan said: There can be no doubt that it is one of the most fundamental parts of the Criminal Procedure Code and non-compliance of Section 235(2) will ex facie vitiate the order. We find from the records that the High Court has only mechanically recorded what the accused has said and no attempt has been made to elicit any information or particulars from the accused or the prosecution which are relevant for awarding a proper sentence. The Bench pointed out that Section 235(2) of the CrPC empowered the Judge to pass sentence on the accused according to law on hearing him. Hearing contemplated is not confined merely to oral hearing but also intended to afford an opportunity to the prosecution as well as the accused to place before the court facts and material relating to various factors on the question of sentence and if either side [should be so interested], to have evidence adduced to show mitigating circumstances to impose a lesser sentence, it said. The Bench said that in this case, though the accused was informed by the court as to the nature of the show-cause notice, no genuine effort has been made by the court to elicit any information either from the accused or the prosecution. High Court has only mechanically recorded what the accused has said: BenchCourt has obligation to elicit relevant facts even if accused is totally silent High Court has only mechanically recorded what the accused has said: Bench Court has obligation to elicit relevant facts even if accused is totally silent  OPEN",

He was staying at Harbour Police Station since December 7, 2010. Soe was picked up by the Indian Navy patrol vessel INS Krishna from about 460 nautical miles off Kalpeni island of Lakshadweep after he jumped off Prantalay 12, a Thai fishing vessel. The Navy later rescued Prantalay 11 and Prantalay 14 too. While others rescued along with him went back from Mumbai, Soe had to stay back. Even though Soe managed to communicate in the little English he knew that his family was killed while migrating from Myanmar to Thailand, he could not produce any documentary evidence. Policemen at the Harbour Station recollected that he used to go into spells of depression. Never during his stay had Soe attempted to learn Malayalam. Even though he understood a little bit of it, he could not speak much. City police officials, in an attempt to help him out, tried to gather more information from him by engaging the wife of a Navy officer, who speaks Thai, and later through a chef at a star hotel. The police also tried to get in touch with the Thai Embassy in Chennai, but to no avail. Soe used to work in a canteen during day time, but always returned to the police station to spend the night. He told the policemen on duty that he was going to Aluva on July 12. He could be communicated over a mobile phone that he had till Thursday and since then, the mobile phone was also switched off. The police have now registered a case of man missing and attempts were on to track the calls he had made from that phone.  OPEN",

The victim alleged that six men had assaulted him following his refusal to comply with the orders of his seniors to dance and do sit-ups. Amit Kumar, a resident of Bhai Parmanand Colony, who is pursuing a Bachelor of Law degree at the Centre, alleged that the assault was a consequence of an argument he had with two of his seniors on March 7, the second day of the colleges annual fest. The victim had complained that it was there that two of his seniors, Chandan Kumar and Narendra Yadav (both students of second year in the same course), came to him and asked him to join them for a dancing session in the college ground. I refused but they kept insisting and even forced me to join them. I did not relent and left for home, said Amit. According to Amit, the following day while he was sitting outside his classroom with a few friends, Chandan and Narendra accompanied by several others reached there. They took the victim to a corner and ordered him to do sit-ups. But once again, Amit refused to give in to their demands and tried to leave. At this, Narendra and Chandan waylaid me and along with their accomplices started punching and kicking me. When they saw several others coming, they left but threatened everyone present there of dire consequences if they told anyone about the incident, he said. Amit immediately made a call to the Police Control Room upon which several policemen reached the college. Amit also told the police that his wallet containing some money and important documents was missing since the incident. Based on his complaint, a case under Sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 341(wrongful restraint), 379 (theft), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) was registered by the police against the accused. Both Chandan and Narendra were arrested from their house on Monday and produced at a local court on Tuesday which sent them to judicial custody.

We have deliberately stayed out of any commitment to tackle Left Wing Extremism, except for giving advice or training, Chief of Army Staff General V.K. Singh said at the annual press conference on the eve of the Army Day. Gen. Singh said the Army was facing problem in training its personnel as there was not enough land available and the proposal to set it up in Chhattisgarh under the Central Command forms part of an integrated plan drawn earlier. Since the Army would be present in the area, it had sought for clarifications from the government on Rules of Engagement' to determine the extent to which its personnel were protected from civil laws. Gen. Singh said the clarification was needed to determine how to engage attackers in case of attacks on the training camp, either by instigation or design. While it is clear that the force does not require any permission to fire in self-defence, the issue is whether resultant causalities on the attackers would attract criminal procedures against the Army personnel and to what extent they are exempt. We are neither operating in the area nor are seeking protection under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, the Army Chief said.   OPEN",

A decision in this regard was taken at a review meeting of district food safety officials convened by Health Secretary Rajeev Sadanandan here on Saturday. It was decided to form squads of food safety officers to conduct inspections at eateries and other food-related businesses to ensure food safety and hygiene during the Christmas-New Year season when food businesses soar. Food safety officials have been asked to conduct necessary inspections to make sure that only licensed catering services are serving food in all mass Christmas and New Year celebrations conducted in auditoriums, where large number of people are likely to consume food. The officials were told to ensure that all employees in hotels and food businesses had health cards and that hotels were keeping a register of the details of the raw materials they were purchasing, including the agencies supplying them. Hotel owners who failed to comply with these conditions would have to face action. The Food Safety Commissioner, Biju Prabhakar, directed officials to conduct inspections at eateries and hotels which had been served notices earlier to ensure that these units were functioning in accordance with the safety and hygiene standards.

During an interaction with the media on the sidelines of an international conference on Conservation of Forests, Wildlife and Ecology, he said the WGEEP report had termed the project undesirable on the basis of inputs provided by the River Research Foundation. They found that there is not enough water to generate the power claimed. This naturally pushes up the cost of generation. The foundation also revealed that the project would affect downstream irrigation schemes and waterfalls impacting on the tourism potential of the area. Besides, it will destroy one of the last low elevation riverine forests. Forest Rights Act Prof. Gadgil said the project would also violate the Forest Rights Act. Yet there is a clamour that Kerala needs it. He said WGEEP had held a meeting with representatives from the River Research Foundation and the government before finalising the observations on the project. The government engineers who were present raised no objections. Hence, we came to the conclusion that there is no justifiable case for a dam. Asked for his opinion on the options for a power-starved State like Kerala, he said the solution lay in demand side management. We are only thinking of generating more power while there is an urgent need to curb wastage and switch over to energy efficient methods. Prof. Gadgil said the panels recommendation to decommission dams that had outlived their age was open to discussion. It is a proposal that can be reversed if convincing arguments can be brought up through a democratic debate. He said the southern regions of the Western Ghats including Kerala were richer in biodiversity and better conserved than northern regions such as Maharashtra and Gujarat.

The superintendent of the centre was transferred and a probe panel has been set up, which will submit a report within two days, based on which further action will be initiated. Case transferred The police, meanwhile, transferred the case from the Kilimanoor police station to the Peroorkada station, where a murder case has been registered. The Peroorkada Circle Inspector would investigate into the case, P. Vimaladitya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order), Thiruvananthapuram City, said. Health Minister V.S. Sivakumar, who paid a visit to the centre late on Saturday, said the superintendent had been transferred to his former post  additional district medical officer  while the Directorate of Health Services had constituted a four-member panel that would probe into the incident and submit a report within two days. The panel began its proceedings by recording statements from the centre staff on Saturday. CCTV cameras The Minister told The Hindu that 20 posts of staff nurses would be created for the MHC, while four assistant surgeon posts too were created. Apart from these, 11 nurses on contract would be recruited via the National Rural Health Mission to tide over the staff shortage in the MHC. The government had also sanctioned Rs.20 lakh to install closed circuit television cameras in the centre. Administrative sanction too had been accorded for this and the cameras were expected to be installed by the end of this month. Plans were also afoot to construct a new building for the centre, Mr. Sivakumar added. The death of the inmate, 60-year-old Venkateswarappa from Andhra Pradesh, found dead in his cell early on December 4, had snowballed into a controversy following the revelation that his cell-mate had allegedly strangled him to death. The body was subjected to a second post-mortem to confirm this. Venkateswarappa was taken into custody following court orders when he was roaming around in Kilimanoor and was admitted to the MHC on November 30. Judicial probe sought Meanwhile, protests and demands for further investigation arose from various quarters with the Kerala Congress and the All India Youth Federation (AIYF) staging separate sit-ins in front of the MHC on Saturday. Communist Party of India (CPI) State secretary Pannian Ravindran, inaugurating the Kerala Congress protest, demanded a judicial probe into the incident, more so because the victim had been admitted to the MHC following court orders. Kerala Congress secretary general George Sebastian also spoke. Later, the AIYF alleged that murders within the mental health centres of the State were becoming regular and that authorities were trying to trivialise such incidents. Demanding that the superintendent of the centre be suspended, they blocked the superintendents office this morning. The protest was called off after the District Medical Officer reached the spot and promised action.  OPEN",

At least six of them, hailing from Kannur district, are suspected to have links with Indian Mujahideen (IM) and the Jam-I-yyathul Ansarul Muslimeen. Dossiers Detailed dossiers released by the Ministry revealed that some have escaped to the Gulf, Pakistan, Nepal or Bangladesh. Many were involved in crimes in the State, including in Kozhikode city, and neighbouring States. Sources said that K.T. Shabir alias Ayub, was involved in the attempt to murder former Chief Minister E.K. Nayanar, the Coimbatore Press Club blast case and recruitment of youths from the State for terror activities in Kashmir. He hails from Marakkarkandi and is alleged to be the kingpin of several terror-linked cases in the country. Two absconding accused, Azhar and P.A. Yusuf, are wanted in the Kozhikode twin blast case of March 2006. One is a native of Sreekandapuram and the other hails from Thalassery. P.A. Raizal, hailing from Mambram, is an accused in the Bangalore serial blast that occurred in 2008. Mohammed Shamir, hailing from Thana, is also an accused in Bangalore bomb blast case. Another fugitive, Shafeek from Thavakkara, is an accused in Kalamassery bus burning case of September 2005. Abdul Rahim, an accused in the case, was killed while trying to cross the border with Pakistan at Kashmir. Suspicion Sources said that more Keralites could be on the list of wanted persons. The list of those hailing from the State had earlier been active members of the proscribed Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and the defunct Islamic Sevak Sangh (ISS). The Indian Mujahideen was formed by Pakistan's ISI to infiltrate into Muslim organisations and execute the agenda of Lashkar-e-Taiba. Thadiyantavide Nazir alias Ummer Haji, the prime accused in the twin-blast case in Kozhikode city, is from Kannur. He is also an accused in the Bangalore serial blast case. Twin cases Abdul Jaleel of Kadachira, Kannur, is an accused arrested for Bangalore blast and for recruiting youth to Jammu and Kashmir. Abdul Jabber, a native of Malappuram, was arrested from Hyderabad on the charge of undergoing training in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

A Major of the Signals Regiment was detained by the family members who called the media to the scene in Mandir Marg in Delhi Cantonment at 2 p.m. The family linked it to the withdrawal of the Z-plus security to Gen Singh, who has been at loggerheads with the establishment for over a year following the controversy over his age. Gen. Singhs family members claimed that Major R. Vikram from 1st Signals Regiment entered their house without prior permission and may have been trying to bug their telephones. We found him [Major] at the house. They [team] could not give any reasonable logic for being here. They had no valid documents. They may have come to bug the phone. We detained, apprehended him. He revealed his identity as Maj. Vikram from 1st Signals Regiment, said Gen. Singhs lawyer Vishwajeet Singh. The Major and his team had some cards with them, he said.  PTI  OPEN",

Rammohan Rao, the boy, Rawoof, had come to the hospital with his mother Neha Fatima, who is five months pregnant and came there for medical check-up. While standing in the queue, she casually spoke to a burqa-clad woman. When asked, the stranger told Ms. Fatima that she was accompanying one of her relatives who had gone inside for medical examination. Before going inside for consultation with the doctor, Ms. Fatima requested the stranger to take care of her son , ACP Rao said. Ms. Fatima first did not suspect the stranger as she had seen Rawoof with her when she came out once in between the examination. But when she returned after the completion of medical examination which took more than hour, the stranger and her son were not to be seen in the queue. Though secret cameras were installed in the hospital, they didnt cover the area where the burqa-clad woman was sitting with the boy. The security guards too could not give any lead about the abductor. Ms. Fatima is from Chandrayangutta. Her husband Younus is an autorickshaw driver.  OPEN",

To begin with, the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), which has been undertaking UAV operations from Begumpet airfield in Hyderabad to support State police and Central armed police forces fighting on the ground, will start executing UAV missions of duration of about 20 hours of flying by this month-end. More UAVs Another important tactical improvement to the anti-Naxal operations would be introduction of at least two more UAVs by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to the current strength of around 10 UAVs being operated by the NTRO. Presently, UAV operations are limited to missions of 8-10 hours duration and restricted to areas up to a range of 450-500 km. But with the increase in flying time, they will be able to cover a larger area with more precision. These missions will cover much larger areas of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha and Maharashtra ... the plan is to focus on 26 worst Maoist-affected districts in these States, a senior Ministry official said. These UAVs would directly send real-time inputs to operation rooms in these States, from where security forces would be immediately alerted about the ground situation and movement of Maoists for swift action against them. Earlier, the UAVs were not being utilised properly as they had limited flying time and there was also delay in the relay of information, but now the UAVs would give extra edge to anti-Naxal operations, the official added. Noting that the increase in the operational hours of UAVs would invariably extend beyond ATC watch hours at Begumpet airfield, the official said: The NTRO has already taken up the issue with the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Airports Authority of India for requisite clearance for extending areas of operations and the need for extended watch hours for ATC Begumpet provided to Central armed police forces. The NTRO recently set up its first base in Chhattisgarh which is linked to satellites to monitor UAVs operations. It has trained CRPFs communication wing officials and deployed them at the Centre for smooth coordination with ground forces. The five V-SAT terminals that have been activated by the NTRO would provide extra edge to our operations, the official added. Similarly, the CRPF has also decided to acquire 16 Nishant UAVs from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), being developed in association with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, which will operate in tandem with Israeli Heron UAVs.

Dr. Alva, a well-known Ayurvedic physician, said commissions offered by pharmaceutical companies to promote their products, and by diagnostic centres and higher centres of medicine for referring patients to them was also a threat to the profession. This is nothing but an unethical practice, which should not be encouraged, he said. He urged doctors to provide treatment with a human touch'. Dr. Alva, who runs a special clinic for people affected by HIV and AIDS at Moddibidri in Dakshina Kannada, said that with proper care and correct treatment, the life span of the patient could be prolonged. In my clinic we have provided continuous treatment and care to 307 AIDS patients over the past six years. Except for six of them, all others are doing well. Lauded He lauded the commitment and contribution of P.S. Shankar, two-time winner of the B.C. Roy Award, to medicine. Referring to the problems encountered by physically challenged persons, the doctor said they needed support not sympathy from society. Basavananda Swami who was visually challenged but had penned several books on health should be an example for others, he said. The swami too was honoured during the anniversary celebrations.

        "content": " In pursuance of a path-breaking order by a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in December last, the Delhi Police are gearing up to upload First Information Reports on the Internet within 24 hours to facilitate supply of their copies to the accused or any person connected with the case. As directed, the FIR copies will be made available online by February 1. It is learnt that the police are at present working out the modalities for implementation of the court order. They are, however, yet to decide where exactly the FIRs will be posted and through what mechanism as the Cyber Highway project under which the police stations are to be interconnected is yet to be implemented. It could be either through a link on the Delhi Police official website or a separate one. Discussions in this regard are under way. Whatever the modalities, if the FIRs are made public through the Internet, even the complainants who on several occasions struggle to get a copy of the FIR would have quick access to it through the Internet. The High Court judgment can have far reaching consequences as it deals with the fundamental issue whether an accused is entitled to a copy of the FIR after it is lodged and if so, what steps are required to be taken to facilitate its availability as the liberty of an individual is inextricably linked with his right to be aware of how he has been booked under law and on what allegations. The Court examined the issue threadbare: How the FIR is to be registered, to whom and when copies have to be submitted, whether it is a public document and whether an accused has the right for a copy and at what stage. Section 207 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which deals with the supply of the copy of the police report and other documents to the accused, states that the magistrate shall without delay furnish to the accused such copies in a case where the proceeding has been instituted on a police report. The Court, however, held that there can be no trace of doubt that FIR is a public document as defined under Section 74 of the Evidence Act. According to the provision, documents of official bodies and tribunals, and of public officers are public documents. The Court stated that fair and impartial investigation is a face of Article 21 of the Constitution and presumption as regards innocence of an accused is a human right. Therefore, a person who is booked under criminal law has a right to know the nature of allegations so that he can take necessary steps to safeguard his liberty. Observing that an accused was entitled to a copy of the FIR even before the stage prescribed under Section 207 of the Cr.P.C., the Court stated that in a case where the police decide against uploading an FIR on the website, the decision shall be taken by an officer not below the rank of Deputy Commissioner of Police. The Court allowed the police to deny copies to the accused in cases of sensitive nature, which includes the concept of privacy. But it also provided a remedy to the accused against this by asking the Police Commissioner to constitute a three-member committee of senior officers within eight weeks to deal with his grievances. While the mechanism for uploading the copies is being devised, many police officers have doubts over the accessibility issue. If we create a system of passwords for access, how would we make them available to the accused? In such a scenario, all copies will have to be made public, said a police officer. Devesh K.

The procession led by chief of Hutatma Co-operative Sugar Mill at Walva in Sangli Vaibhav Naikwadi, reached the office with banners portraying slogans demanding road repairs. The protestors said sugar mills paid crores of rupees by way of tax to the government, which fails to construct sound roads in and around the sugar mills. Superintending engineer D.Y.

The test kit takes only three hours to produce the results and is economical. Each test costs Rs. 25, according to a DFRL press release. Incubator  The kit can be used for conducting tests simultaneously on a large number of samples and it is user-friendly. Except for an incubator, no other equipment is needed to carry out the tests. Besides this, confirmatory identification of all salmonella serovars, shigella species, E. coli group and proteus species could be done using the kit, said the release. The kit has been tested at the DFRL with a number of reference strains and clinical samples. The third-party evaluation of the kit has been carried out successfully at the JSS Medical College, Mysore; SDM Medical College, Dharwad; and Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore. The kit detects salmonella genus, shigella genus, entire E. coli group along with proteus vulgaris/mirabilis at the same time employing monoclonal antibody based simple dot ELISA and a set of four biochemical tests. According to the DFRL, potential users of the test kit are microbiology departments of all medical, veterinary colleges, diagnostic medical and veterinary laboratories, analytical and quality control food laboratories, CFLs of the armed forces, food export inspection agencies, and disease control and outbreak investigation institutions. Conventional methodology for identifying pathogenic microorganisms is based on isolation in pure cultures, biochemical and serological tests. These tests are tedious and time consuming, the release said. Fewer detection systems for the rapid detection of pathogenic microorganisms from food and clinical samples are available commercially. Immunoassays such as ELISA tests use polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies or a combination of both. However, the use of polyclonal antibodies in these tests may produce a high number of false positive results, the DFRL release said. The kit was released by K. Shekar, scientist and Chief Controller (R and D), DRDO, at the Lab Raising Day of DFRL here recently.

This inconvenience, according to the Bangalore Traffic Police is due to multiple agencies executing developmental work at the junction simultaneously. While Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) has started work on a crossover for metro trains at this junction, the Bangalore Development Authority is proceeding with construction of the grade separator. On the other hand, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) and Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd., (KPTCL) are eager to dig up the road to lay their lines through this junction. A sewage line work of BWSSB near The Club, which has been progressing for months together, also has been affecting traffic near the Raja Rajeshwari Arch. Because of Metro and BDA works, the width of Mysore Road near the junction has shrunk to just half its original size, causing a huge pile-up of vehicles on both sides of the junction. As the vehicular traffic entering as well as leaving the city through Mysore road pass through Nayandahalli junction, vehicles are found queuing up, particularly during peak hours, till Bangalore University Gate on one side of the junction and till Kimco Junction (off BHEL) on the other. Vehicles, particularly buses, take at least 45 minutes to cross this junction during peak hours. Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic and Security) Praveen Sood said it would have been better had the agencies taken up the work one after the other. Multiple agencies simultaneously executing the work at the junction has caused the congestion, he said and added that the police have already urged BDA to go slow till Bangalore Metro completes the work. Most complicated' Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic-West) Panduranga H. Rane said that the Nayandahalli Junction has been the most complicated junction in the city. With the opening of the railway underpass, the volume of traffic on the ORR has considerably increased. One more traffic signal had to be created at this junction, which earlier had three signal posts, he said. Mr. Rane said he had arranged a free left turn towards the railway underpass for the incoming traffic and re-alignment of the carriageway for the outgoing traffic at this junction, which has eased the situation considerably. There is no other solution in the present set up, Mr. Rane said and feared the worse in the coming days. BDA Commissioner Bharat Lal Meena said the grade separator work has already been awarded and the contractor has commenced the work. We will discuss the issue with the traffic police again, he said, without hinting about going slow on the project.

        "content": " Two months after taking charge as Minister for Communications and IT, Kapil Sibal on Saturday announced a 100-day plan for his Ministry that has been hit by allegations of a massive scam in the allocation of 2G spectrum. Besides promising transparency in the high-growth telecom sector and formulation of a new telecom policy, Mr. Sibal also talked about making post offices a new channel for financial empowerment for rural India and tackling cyber crime with greater efficiency. Within the next 100 days, we will hold consultations with key stakeholders to evolve a clear and transparent telecom regime covering licensing, spectrum allocation, tariffs/pricing, flexibility within licences, spectrum sharing, spectrum trading and, merger and acquisitions. We need a new comprehensive policy to take care of our future requirements, Mr. Sibal told journalists here. Taking a dig at his predecessor, A. Raja, who is alleged to have caused the national exchequer presumptive loss of over Rs.1.76-lakh crore in allocation of 2G spectrum, Mr. Sibal said: Current issues in the telecom sector that everyone is today talking about are due to lack of transparency in the sector. We will address all pending issues related to policy, spectrum, licences and security in a very transparent manner to ensure that the growth of the sector is not affected in any way. Underlining the need to replace the National Telecom Policy 1999 with a new comprehensive policy, Mr. Sibal said: Three elements  reasonable revenue for government, affordable services to users and robust growth of the sector  would be kept in mind while framing the new policy. We need to balance all these three elements. The government should not get revenue at the cost of industry, while industry should not make super normal profits at the cost of consumers by keeping tariffs high. Asserting that efforts would be made to include telecom under infrastructure sector and treat it as essential services, Mr. Sibal said: We will try and make spectrum available to the industry after initiating a dialogue with the Department of Space, Ministries of Information and Broadcasting and Defence to get the spectrum vacated for civil use. The Minister further said DoT would ensure speedy implementation of mobile number portability (MNP) that allows subscribers to retain their number while changing the service provider. DoT plans to provide MNP in the entire country by January 20. Similarly, on security-related issues regarding 3G services and BlackBerry, he said: All issues will be resolved soonsteps will be taken to enable operators to launch services without delay. Similarly, security issues regarding telecom equipment procurement and subscriber verification will also be resolved. Steps will be taken to establish the Central Monitoring System which would facilitate and prevent misuse of lawful interception facility, he added. Mr. Sibal also said the Department of Posts would collaborate with leading private sector banks  the IDBI, HSBC and ICICI Bank  to provide White Label Pre-paid Cards' to rural people to facilitate non-cash based transactions for purchase of products and services. Talking about plans for Department of IT, Mr. Sibal said the Ministry would frame and notify rules for data protection and liabilities of service providers under the Information Technology Act to enhance cyber security. We will also bring out a draft consultation for policy on rolling out mobile governance and draft the Electronic Service Delivery Bill. As part of various e-governance initiatives, the government will focus on nationwide roll-out of e-district mission mode project and draft the Electronic Service Delivery Bill. A draft consultation document on policy for mobile governance will also be brought out, he added. A pilot scheme for providing digital literacy to women, especially in rural areas, will also be introduced in the next 100 days. The Department of IT would also set up a National Electronic Mission, while efforts would be made to attract investment in semiconductor units and promote innovation and intellectual property rights. A national facility for assessing quality of biometric devices for Unique Identification applications will be set up, apart from infrastructure at Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad for testing of large area photovoltaic modules, Mr. Sibal added.

Chairman of the National Fish workers Forum (NFF) Matanhy Saldanha told The Hindu here on Friday that the draft notification, brought out in September 2010, had drawn the ire of the fishing communities for its failure to reverse the liberal permissions that were provided for industries by the much amended CRZ notification of 1991 that was currently in vogue. Mr. Saldanha disclosed that the Minister for Environment Jairam Ramesh, during the second round of interactions with NFF representatives in New Delhi on Wednesday, announced that the new notification would come out in the first week of January after making the modifications agreed upon. In a significant policy pronouncement, he also agreed that the Ministry would start working on replacing the notification with an Act of Parliament. According to Mr. Saldanha, while recognising that some important differences remain, the Minister agreed to many of the fishing community demands. The former Goa Tourism Minister said that the provisions for housing for fishermen were also felt to be grossly inadequate. Though the draft notification came in the wake of a series of public consultations in all coastal States, most of them attended by the Minister of Environment, the fishing communities strongly felt that their views were not properly reflected in the draft. The coast-wide mobilisation against the draft notification under the leadership of the NFF on October 29 found significant support from political leaders and State governments, notably Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

The party with its increased numbers both in Assembly and Parliament, would be in a better position to bargain for a separate Telangana as there would be an alliance both in State and at the Centre, Mr. Rao said. Mr. Rao, son of TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR), was here to take part in the Basti baata, the party propaganda programme that envisages going door-to-door in urban localities to seek public support. In this age of coalition politics, every seat matters. People should support TRS as it has been fighting for the separate Telangana, the aspiration of four crore people. Both the Congress and the TDP restrain their leaders from uttering even the word Telangana. People need not beg the mainstream political parties anymore. If we can ensure a strong TRS party by next elections, we can demand our statehood, Mr. Rao said. Describing the proposed all-party meeting on December 28 as a big drama, party MLAs K. Rama Rao, T. Rajaiah and D. Vinay Bhaskar said the true colours of all parties would be known on that day. The people of Telangana would chase the leaders undertaking padayatra away if they spoke against the Telangana at the meeting. Both Chandrababu Naidu and Sharmila Reddy can go on with their programme until December 28. After that, people of Telangana will decide their programme, the TRS leaders said. Referring to the controversy over reported offer by KCR to Congress MPs, Mr. Rao said anybody willing to work for the separate Telangana would be supported by the TRS or welcomed into party. We always want the TDP and Congress leaders of Telangana region to come out and fight for the people of the region rather than work under the tyrannical Andhra and Rayalaseema leaders. We stand by it and we welcome anyone willing to fight for the separate Telangana cause, he said.

Tyagi, and his three cousins, besides nine others and six companies, have been named by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the case it registered in the VVIP chopper scam. The agency suspects the retired Air Chief Marshal had approved certain changes in the tender specifications that opened the doors for the Italian firm AgustaWestland to bid for the contract. A fortnight after the agency instituted a Preliminary Enquiry into the matter, it registered a case of alleged corruption, conspiracy and cheating against the 13 accused persons, six companies and their unknown accomplices under various provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code. The CBI has alleged that AgustaWestland paid bribes through middlemen to influence public servants in order to swing the deal  for supply of 12 VVIP helicopters  in its favour. The CBI has alleged that during his tenure, the former IAF chief approved the reduction of the service ceiling of VVIP helicopters from 6,000 metres to 4,500 metres, a move that was previously opposed consistently by the IAF citing security related issues. AgustaWestland, which could not have qualified for the tender, was allowed to bid because of the relaxation made in the specifications, said a source in the agency. The agency on Wednesday conducted searches in Delhi, Gurgaon, Chandigarh and Mohali at the residences of Mr. Tyagi and the other accused persons and companies. Among those named in the case are the retired IAF chiefs cousins Julie, Docsa and Sandeep Tyagi; Chief Executive Officer of Aeromatrix Info Solution Private Limited Praveen Bakshi; IDS Infotech Chairman Satish Bagrodia and its Managing Director Pratap K. Aggarwal; and advocate Gautam Khaitan. Giuseppe Orsi, the then CEO of AgustaWestlands parent company Finmeccanica; and Bruno Spagnolini, the then CEO of United Kingdom-based AgustaWestland, have also been named along with alleged middlemen Guido Ralph Haschke, Carlo Valentino Ferdinando Gerosa and Christian Michel. The companies named in the case are Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland, IDS (Tunisia), Infotech Design System (Mauritius), IDS Infotech (Mohali) and Aeromatrix (Chandigarh). It is alleged that in the procurement process of the helicopters, some persons acted as middlemen and allegedly influenced the deal in favour of the U.K.-based company. It is also alleged that the Italy-based company paid commissions running into several million Euros to the middlemen who, from their share, allegedly paid huge sums of money to some Indian nationals under the garb of engineering contracts with the two India-based companies, said a CBI official. According to the sources in the CBI, investigations so far revealed that Mr. Michel was allegedly paid 30 million Euros by the supplier company for the job and a part of that money is suspected to have made its way to India.

As a result, people in many areas are forced to buy water in tankers, spending about Rs. 200 a day. Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, Mr. Shetty said that the city corporation had hiked the water tariff from Rs. 640 to Rs. 2,100 a year for each consumer. The Congress had opposed the hike. Although the government had promised to examine and revise the water tariff, the rate remained unchanged. After having hiked the water tariff, the corporation had not bothered to supply drinking water at least once in two days, he said. The corporation had failed to manage water resources properly. If the corporation did not start supplying water once in two days, the Congress, along with citizens, would stage a dharna in front of its office, he said. Underpasses Referring to the ongoing work on the old and new underpasses, Mr. Shetty alleged that the quality was very poor and adequate reinforcement had not been used in the construction. He said the reconstruction of one underpass had been assigned to BJP Yuva Morcha president Pisale Srinivas and another to veteran BJP leader Pratap.

        "content": " The Madras High Court has dismissed petitions challenging a regulation of ESI (General) Regulations 1950, which requires all factories or establishments to register themselves under the Employees State Insurance (ESI) Act. Passing a common order on two writ petitions, Justice K. Chandru said even in cases where no employer code had been allotted or in respect of any factory or establishment to which the law was earlier applicable but ceased to apply for the time being, they should furnish proper registration form to the ESI Corporation. Pavis Textiles and Arun Textiles in T. Kailasampalayam, Tiruchengode taluk, Namakkal district, moved the Madras High Court praying to declare Regulation 10 B of the ESI (General) regulation illegal, ultra vires and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The petitioners contended that after providing all medical facilities, the question of coverage under the ESI Act or in the alternative seeking for payment of subscription would not arise. Dismissing the petitions, Mr. Justice Chandru said it was not clear as to how the petitioners could challenge the regulation without challenging the substantive provision of the Act. The regulation resembled Section 2-A of the Act. When there was a substantial provision obliging the employer to register the establishment in the manner prescribed and also the regulations had been made to carry out the purpose of Section 2-A, there could not be any challenge to the regulation independent of the Act's main provisions. It was not known as to how the petitioners were invoking Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution for impugning the Regulation 10-B when it had no relevance of this nature. The challenge to the regulation was misconceived. Interest on belated payments In another order, dismissing a petition by M.M. Rubber Company Ltd., Chennai, Mr. Justice Chandru held that insofar as the ESI Act was concerned, payment of interest was a must on delayed payment of contributions. On the question of interest, it should be noted that the Supreme Court had held that there could not be any private negotiations and the interest was an automatic liability on the employer if there were delayed payments.

Addressing a press conference at the party office on Friday, Keshav observed that the Krishna River Water Tribunal verdict dealt a severe blow to the coastal and delta districts' water resources; more so on Rayalaseema districts' resources, particularly Anantapur. The verdict upheld the demands of Karnataka and Maharashtra and catered to all their projects besides legitimising the height increase of Almatti dam by Karnataka. The tribunal also increased allocation of Krishna water to Almatti dam from 510 metres to 526 meters and allocated an additional 258 tmc of water to Karnataka. This, he said, adversely affected the prospects of Andhra Pradesh and instead of increasing water allocation to the State; it actually reduced the present supply by 200 tmc of water. Unwise move He blamed the ruling Congress government for signing an affidavit that the State would not ask for additional allocation. It was unwise to sign the undertaking and by doing so, the government has deprived the State of a right to demand additional allocation of water, he added. Looming uncertainty The condition of the Tungabhadra has become precarious due to the tribunal allocating 360 tmc of water to the Tungabhadra sub basin. The water resources in Srisailam reservoir, too, had declined. Not only 10 tmc water supply to the PABR dam has become questionable, but the fate of all new projects are now hanging in uncertainty, MLA Palle Raghunath Reddy opined.

The mood for the debate was set by Congress leader K. Muraleedharan who, while participating in the debate, came down heavily on the anti-democratic postures of the CPI(M) leadership which failed to recognise the peoples mandate in the Neyyattinkara by-election. Referring to several instances of the CPI(M) throwing out revered leaders, he pointed out that times had changed and many of those who had been disowned by the CPI(M) had returned to the Assembly stronger than before. He criticised the attack on women councillors by pro-left employees union members and questioned the democratic sensibilities of the CPI(M). The T.P. Chandrasekharan, Fazal, and Sukhoor murder cases dominated the debate for a major part. Opposition members Elamaram Karim, V.S. Sunil Kumar, K.K. Lathika, C.K. Nanu, and A.K. Saseendran criticised the manner in which the police handled striking SFI activists in the capital city on Monday. Mr. Karim was the most vehement in his criticism of the police actionHe found a hidden political agenda in the manner the CPI(M) was being targeted. CPI(M) deputy leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan justified the LDF governments decision to challenge the High Courts order for a CBI probe in the Fazal murder case. He said the LDF government had challenged all cases that had been referred to the Central agency without its permission. He alleged that conferred IPS officials were being appointed in the districts in order to help the Congress carry out its political agenda. A.P.

The police identified the deceased as Philip Raj, a construction worker, a native of Pudukkottai. He was residing on New Colony, 4 th Cross Street, Chromepet, with some co-workers. On Friday night, a group of workers had a New Year party on the terrace while Raj and a friend, identified as Eswaran (45), stayed on the ground floor and consumed alcohol. Around 6.15 a.m. on Saturday, Raj was found dead by some of his roommates and Eswaran was missing, police said.  A 28-year-old man, who allegedly set his wife ablaze in an argument on Friday night, is absconding. The woman has been admitted to the Kilpauk Medical College Hospital. According to police, Anbu, a painter on Netaji Street, Thirumalai Nagar, Valasaravakkam, quarrelled with his wife Mary (26) after she asked him to come to church on New Year's eve. A disappointed Mary threatened self immolation. Anbu, who was enraged by her response, allegedly poured kerosene on Mary and set her ablaze. Hearing Mary's cries, neighbours took her to the hospital.  A 21-year-old woman, admitted to Kilpauk Medical College Hospital on Friday night with severe burns, died in the early hours of Saturday. The police said Sowmya of Villivakkam was married to Suresh Kumar (28) for the last two years. Kumar had allegedly harassed Sowmya for more dowry to diversify his business. On Friday evening, neighbours heard her screams and rushed in to see Sowmya on fire. They took her to the hospital, where she succumbed to burns. Suresh Kumar, who was in the house, also suffered burns in his arm, police said. Sowmya's mother, Stella Mary (42), lodged a complaint on Saturday accusing Suresh Kumar of dowry harassment. An RDO inquiry has been ordered into the death. The Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the city police on Thursday arrested two men, who made fake documents for a land in Kancheepuram and sold it to a man in Anna Nagar. Sources in the CCB said Kumar of T. Nagar and Peter of Kelambakkam created fake documents for five grounds of land in Kancheepuram district, which belongs to Sangamithra and sold it to Sanjeev Reddy (51) of Ponni Colony, Anna Nagar. The duo also made documents as if the earlier owner, Radhakrishan, who sold the land to Sangamithra in 1992, issued power of attorney to them said. A CCB team investigated the matter and arrested Kumar and Peter.  OPEN",

While the girl was a Shia, the boy belonged to the Sunni community. Additional Sessions Judge Bimla Kumari sentenced to death Mohammed Saleem, Shaheen Abbas, Sajid Wasim, Shaheen Zargam Ali and Shabbir Kasim for murdering Tariq, the brother of Sadiq, whom the girl had married. All of them were residents of the Walled City of Delhi and the murder was committed on July 7, 2008, in Ballimaran. This is the second instance in the last four months of a Delhi trial court awarding death sentence for an honour killing. On May 12, a Saket court had handed out death sentence to the husband, mother-in-law and brother-in-law of a 32-year-old woman whom they killed in cold blood in the presence of her three children for demanding transfer of a piece of land to her children. Writing her order, the judge said: In the present case, the prosecution has successfully proved the motive behind the murder of deceased Tariq, which was the love marriage between the girl and Sadiq. Thus the case of prosecution falls under the category of honour killingSince honour killing comes in the category of rarest of rare cases as held by the Supreme Court in the Bhagwan Das case (May 8, 2011), I have no option but to award the death sentence to all accused in respect of the offence under IPC Section 302 (murder) read with Section 34 (common intention) of the IPC. Among the convicts, Mohammed Saleem and Shaheen Zargam Ali were uncles of the girl, while Sajid Wasim and Shabbir Kasim were her brothers and Shaheen Abbas, a cousin. The prosecution said the convicts came to know that the couple had come to live at Sadiq's parental home. Sadiq was forcibly taken by Shaheen Zargam Ali on his motorcycle on July 7, 2008, to a mosque in the locality where the other accused were waiting for them. Sadiq's brothers, Tariq and Tayyab, gave chase and followed them to the mosque where an argument ensued. The accused attacked Tariq and his brother Tayyab, and shot them with a country-made pistol. Tariq succumbed to his injuries while Tayyab was severely injured.   OPEN",

        "content": " Expressing concern over heightened levels of violence against political workers in West Bengal, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the number of killings was alarming and pointed to a virtual collapse of law and order in parts of the State. In his letter of December 30, 2010 to West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, a copy of which was released on Friday, the Home Minister said that he had used the word harmad' (hired killers) in an earlier letter as it was extensively used in the media, but would use any other word to describe armed cadres that Mr. Bhattacharjee would care to suggest. Mr. Bhattacharjee had taken strong exception to the use of the nasty word in Mr. Chidambaram's letter last week. Not a happy situation Mr. Chidambaram agreed with Mr. Bhattacharjee that it was not a happy situation considering the level of violence in the State. He had on Thursday sent two letters to Mr. Bhattacharjee, in reply to the Chief Minister's December 28 communication. Both letters were faxed as well as sent by speed post. While you have put the number of Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadres killed and injured at 69 and 723 respectively, according to our information they are 65 and 773 respectively. The figures are not very different. In fact, there is broad agreement on the numbers killed and injured. If our numbers are broadly correct in the case of CPI(M) cadres killed and injured, there is no reason to doubt our numbers regarding Trinamool Congress and Congress cadres killed and injured. These numbers have been gathered in [a uniform] manner and from the same sources. Taken together, the numbers are alarming and that is why I said that they point to a virtual collapse of law and order in parts of West Bengal, Mr. Chidambaram said in the letter. Agreeing with the Chief Minister's view that the CPI (Maoist) had a significant presence in three districts of West Bengal and that the challenge was containing them both administratively and politically, he pointed out that it was towards this end that the Centre provided substantial support by deploying Central forces upon request. The question that remains unanswered in your letter is: if armed cadres continue to take upon themselves the duties of maintaining law and order, what is the role of the security forces, especially of the Central paramilitary forces that have been deployed at the request of the State government, he said. In the second letter, Mr. Chidambaram clarified his use of the word harmad' to describe the armed cadres. I do not think that the word is per se offensive but, should you suggest another word or phrase to describe the armed cadres referred to in my letter, I shall be happy to use that word or phrase, he said. Both of us should focus on the substance of my letter and not be distracted by extraneous matters, Mr. Chidambaram said. He also invited Mr. Bhattacharjee to the capital for a frank discussion on this extremely sensitive issue, to agree upon the way forward, indicating his availability from January 3 to January 7, 2011.

The letter was written on Friday and made available to the media at the State Secretariat. I wanted not to open all our correspondences before the media, but to discuss with you the problems when I meet you in Delhi.

I am sorry that I cannot offer you any such word since I am unable to accept your attitude towards Left-Front workers in our State, [as is] your observation regarding failure of law and order in certain areas, the Chief Minister said in his letter.

A tanker lorry carrying aviation turbine fuel hit a stationary lorry with protruding logs of woods in the early hours of the day. Though the highly inflammable fuel leaked from one of the compartments of the tanker lorry, timely intervention by the Fire Force and the police prevented a fire which could have caused heavy damage to life and property. Incidents of LPG bullet tankers bursting into flames after getting involved in road accidents have happened in Kerala in recent times. Fire accidents involving LPG carriers at Kannur and Karunagappally are fresh in the memory of the people of the State. The roads with its inherent shortcomings, offer no safe mode for transporting the inflammable material. Such hazardous materials could have been transported through the States waterways using roll-in, roll-out vessels. Each of these vessels can transport many lorries laden with goods.

It was the worst mass shooting in the U.S. since the 2007 shooting on the Virginia Tech campus. Some moviegoers said they thought the attack was part of the show. Then they saw a silhouette of a person in the smoke at the front of the theatre, pointing a gun at the crowd. I told my friend, Weve got to get out of here, but then he shot people trying to go out the exits, Jennifer Seeger told NBCs Today. She the shooter made his way up the aisle, shooting as he went, saying nothing. Some of the injured were children, with the youngest a 3-month-old baby. Victims were being treated for chemical exposure apparently related to canisters thrown by the gunman. The shooter, a man in his 20s, was arrested shortly after the midnight attack near a car outside the multiplex theatre in Aurora. FBI spokesman Jason Pack said there was no indication in the investigation so far of any connection to terror groups. President Barack Obama said he was saddened by the horrific and tragic shooting. It was the worst mass shooting in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, where two students opened fire and killed 12 classmates and a teacher. Aurora police spokesman Frank Fania said he didnt know yet if all the injuries were gunshot wounds. He said some might have been caused by other things, such as shrapnel. The suspect was taken into custody. There was no immediate word of a motive.  OPEN",

        "content": " Why did it take the death of four young students, whose lives were full of hope, for the Tamil Nadu government to wake up to footboard travel in Chennai? After all, this phenomenon of people hanging on tenuously to a Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) bus is not new. It is something that the corporations line inspectors are expected to report on regularly  and ensure that more buses are run to ease crowding. The answer is simple: the ratio of buses to population in the State capital is miserably low, and this broken system has not been repaired. Two years ago, the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) was reminded in an official report that the citys bus service was bursting at the seams. In 1981, there were 41 buses per lakh population. The system remained under-funded in subsequent decades in spite of rapid economic growth: the ratio was 41 in 1991, 40 in 2001 and 40 in 2008. In 1971, it was 29. This is what the official Comprehensive Transportation Study for the city states. Obviously, no one takes these reports seriously. There is something else that is fundamentally wrong. The Tamil Nadu government is dragging its foot on a new law. The Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) Act 2010 provides that CUMTA, made up of many agencies including bus and rail managers, will promote the cause of public mass passenger transport systems and regulate measures for integration of all public mass passenger transport modes and para-transit modes. It will fix fares, promote research to improve transport and regulate measures to reduce accidents. Importantly, it will also prepare a Comprehensive Transport Plan for the city. One would imagine that if a government is keen, it would quickly get to work with such a law in place. But this is far from the case. Even the draft rules required to operationalise the Act have not been finalised. We are now approaching 2013, with no signs of progress. It would help to have a deadline for such initiatives, and a public consultation on what the commuter needs. CUMTA seems to have lost sight of the stunting of bus transport growth, which is hurting us here and now. This neglect kills and maims. The Chennai Comprehensive Transportation Study of 2010 has now been adopted as the Comprehensive Transportation Plan. It states that Vehicle growth trends reveal that the fleet of buses has seen a very marginal increase over the years. It also takes note of substantial overcrowding on MTC buses during peak hours, exceeding 100 per bus. The government, it appears, doesnt think we should be complaining about enforced cattle class travel on MTC, often at deluxe fares. If Tamil Nadu is serious about orderly urbanisation, it must invest. It has to modernise its bus system, and plan ahead for expansion of the Metro Rail along arteries of housing development to Sriperumbudur, Sholinganallur, Oragadam and so on. So far, it has been coasting along with big grant funds from the Union ministry of urban development under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission bus scheme. That move brought a large number of buses with doors, better designs and LED boards to Chennai. But bad maintenance has turned most of them rickety. Now, the ministry has come up with fresh standards for urban bus design that provide for doors  and safety. MTC should be compelled to order only such standard-compliant buses for the mini-bus scheme and for expansion of its fleet. It must also quickly convert all existing city buses into modern ones with doors. The citizen has a right to travel safely, in comfort.  The ratio of buses to population is miserably low in the State capital  OPEN",

        "content": " Four autorickshaw drivers, against whom a case was registered for assaulting tourists in the city, surrendered themselves before the Ernakulam Judicial First Class Magistrate judge Biju V.J. on Tuesday. They were later remanded and handed over to the Town Central Police. The police were on the lookout for the four for allegedly assaulting Raji Varghese, wife of Prem Malhotra of New Delhi, and her family on May 11. The incident happened when the family arrived at the Ernakulam Town North railway station after visiting tourist spots in the State. They hired three autorickshaws to take them from the station to the KSRTC stand. While two autorickshaw drivers collected Rs.60 for the trip, Soorya, 24, a native of Tamil Nadu and a resident of Kochu Kadavanthra, demanded Rs.80. When Ms. Malhotra complained, he assaulted her and her family with an iron rod. Mr. Malhotra suffered a cut on the eyebrow and their 17-year-old son Yatin Malhotra suffered a fracture on his right hand. The assault was recorded on the surveillance camera installed at the KSRTC terminal. The other autorickshaw drivers who were involved in the incident were Noushad, 41, of Mattanchery; Raghavan, 24, of Kathrikadavu; and Rajesh, 32, of Mulavukadu. After the incident, Soorya, the main accused, left for his home in Coimbatore. The police team had been tracking his mobile phone since then. Salauddeen, who was arrested earlier, was in remand and released on bail after a month. The police have also sent recommendations to the Regional Transport Office to cancel the driving licences and autorickshaw permits of the accused. The vehicle operated by Soorya was taken into custody by the police immediately after the incident. Other vehicles would also be taken into custody soon, said police sources. Repeated attempts by the accused to secure bail were turned down by the court. The City Police have decided to install cameras in more public places as part of the intensified drive against crimes like chain snatching, pick-pocketing and harassment of women.  The assault was recorded on the surveillance camera installed at the KSRTC terminal.  OPEN",

U. Arulanandam, President of Alliance for Release of Innocent Fishermen (ARIF), told The Hindu , that fishermen from Rameswaram and Pamban who had set out for fishing on Saturday morning and returned on Sunday, had told him about the atrocities committed by the Sri Lankan Navy on them. The Navy personnel had taken away a GPS unit worth Rs. 60,000 from a fisherman. They cut the nets and threw into the sea, spare nets kept in the boats. They also took away the catch from some boats, Mr. Arulanandam said quoting the fishermen. Meanwhile, sources in the Fisheries department said four Rameswaram based fishermen were missing after they ventured into the sea on Saturday morning. The search operation could not be launched on Sunday as the sea was rough. The coast guard would be alerted if the fishermen failed to trace them. Mr. Arulanandam said following gusty winds, a boat, carrying four fishermen from Uchipuli drifted away and got stuck in the sands in the island after hitting a rock. He said he spoke to one of the fisherman over phone and said they are all safe. A boat would be deployed on Monday to rescue them, he added.  OPEN",

Delivering a lecture here on Saturday on Financial sector reforms  Impact on Indian economy, jointly organised by the Bank Employees Federation of India, and Insurance Corporation Employees Union, Mr. Athreya said the last two decades of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation had seen a huge and continuing agrarian crisis with over 2,50,000 farmers committing suicide. Growth in the agriculture sector had been the lowest since Independence, with the annual growth rate being just 0.6 per cent between 1994 and 2004. Slashing of subsidies on agricultural inputs, removal of restrictions on the import of agricultural produce, increase in the cost of bank and cooperative credits to agricultural and allied activities, cut in development expenditure, and weakening of food security by imposing targeted public distribution system have had a devastating effect on the rural economy, he said. There was also a massive increase in unemployment. Economy was registering a high rate of inflation, he said. Recent surveys have stated that reforms had resulted in the spread of poverty, he said. In complete violation of parliamentary democracy, the government had permitted Foreign Direct Investment in multi-brand retail, when an overwhelming majority in Parliament had opposed the move in October 2011, Mr. Athreya said.

        "content": " Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is making full-fledged attempts to infiltrate Indias strategic organisations by spoofing telephone calls and using malware to snoop into crucial websites and systems. Sounding an alert regarding such espionage attempts from across the border, the Intelligence Bureau has warned that Pakistans intelligence operatives (PIOs) were targeting defence forces headquarters and other strategic organisations to collect sensitive information. PIOs are frequently targeting government personnel/officers to collect sensitive information through spoofed VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calls prefixed with the STD code of DelhiThe PIOs have been using the stratagem of calling phone numbers of security forces posing as officers belonging to Army/Navy/Air Force HQ (headquarters) and collecting details about the deployment, movement and other information about security forces, says an internal note of the IB. The ISI operatives are also targeting Indian Railways, banks, and serving/retired employees and civil contractors working for Military Engineering Services (MES) to collect sensitive and defence-related information. They (PIOs) have also been making telephone calls under assumed identities by using spoofed numbers to various CPMFs (central paramilitary forces), railways, banks etc, the note says. They (PIOs) have succeeded in ferreting out sensitive information from the persons attending these calls. IB has been regular in highlighting the stratagem of PIOs using fake identities, the note adds. The IB has now asked the Department of Telecom to constitute a high-level technical committee to examine the issue of spoofed calls and find possible solutions that could be implemented in a time-bound manner. Explaining how the ISI has managed to infiltrate Indias communication networks, the IB note adds: Using VoIP and computer software to mask the point of origin of their calls, Pakistans intelligence operatives have been noticed to be masquerading as senior Indian armed forces officers to contact their targets on the telephone to collect such information. The modus operandi involves the use of software by PIOs operating from Pakistan to ensure that the mobile phone of the target displays the incoming call to be originating from a spoofed Indian number. Though these VoIP calls originate outside India, they reflect an Indian-specific CLI (caller line identification). Referring to a recent incident of espionage, the IB note points out that, in February this year, it had sounded an alert regarding possible contamination of BSNL systems by the ISI. This stratagem now appears to have been successfully used by them for a cyber offensive against the subscriber database and communication links of BSNL, it adds.  OPEN",

While Defence Minister A.K. Antony did not directly accuse Pakistan of the killing  he made a carefully worded statement in both Houses of Parliament blaming the ambush on approximately 20 heavily armed terrorists along with persons dressed in Pakistan Army uniforms  Islamabad rejected accusations by the Indian media of involvement of its troops in the incident. But as the electronic media ratcheted up its rhetoric on the incident, statements by leaders, including those in the Government, acquired a sharper edge. Winding up his response in the Rajya Sabha in the evening, Mr. Antony predicated New Delhis response on signals and actions from Pakistan. United Progressive Alliance Chairperson Sonia Gandhi declared that India would not be cowed down by such acts of deceit while the Bharatiya Janata Party urged the government to reply to Pakistan in the same language. Mr. Antonys statement left open the possibility of the persons in uniform being soldiers or terrorists dressed to look like them, a question that could get clarified once the Army completes its investigations. Speaking to the media, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid warned that the incident could affect the bilateral relationship with Islamabad. The normalisation process was taking place because of signals from Pakistan. But if objective conditions for that were not met, it will be difficult for anyone on our side to move forward, he cautioned. Soon after news of the post-midnight ambush broke, India summoned Pakistans Deputy High Commissioner Mansoor Ahmed Khan and lodged a strong protest over the attack by assailants who came from across the Line of Control.On its part, Islamabad rejected allegations that its troops were involved and said Pakistani military authorities have confirmed that there had been no exchange of fire that could have resulted in such an incident. The attack takes place when prospects for resumption of peace talks had brightened with a new government in saddle in Islamabad and the two sides appeared to have got over the previous skirmish on the LoC in January this year, in which an Indian soldier was beheaded. Officials had earlier said both sides could hold talks this month on the least controversial and easily resolvable disputes over demarcation of the border in Sir Creek and barrages being built by India on rivers common to both countries.

Justice M.

The judge said that it would only be advisable for the magistrates to hand over interim custody of seized vehicles to their owners by exercising judiciously as well as expeditiously, the powers conferred on them under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Grant of such interim custody would ensure that the owners do not suffer because of the vehicles lying unused for long. It would also take off the responsibility of the court or the police to keep them in safe custody until the conclusion of the confiscation proceedings. If necessary, the magistrates could prepare a Panchnama containing the details of the vehicle and get them signed by the owners in order to use them as evidence during the trial instead of insisting on physical production of the vehicle. Such interim custody was being granted by the magistrates with respect to vehicles involved in offences under the Indian Penal Code, the same could be followed while dealing with Essential Commodities Act too as there was no bar under the special legislation for granting such custody, the judge added.

The All-Manipur Working Journalists' Union said in a statement that Mr. Singh received a call from someone claiming to be a member of the banned armed group, the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), on December 28. He wanted to set up a meeting with three members of the union, of which Mr. Singh is the spokesman and vice-president, to discuss issues relating to the publication of KCP's statements. When the supposed KCP member said that the meeting would be held in New Delhi, Mr. Singh said that the union had no fund for such travels. The agent then offered to foot the bill and said would he send the required funds. The next morning two Manipur police commandos in civilian dress came to his office on Sega Road in a rickshaw and asked him to collect the money. When he came near the duo, he was manhandled and taken to custody, said the statement. He tried to fight them off thinking them to be insurgents, but later they identified themselves as police commandos. The statement also alleges that the police seized Rs.50,000 which they brought with them, and Rs.2,000 from Mr. Singh. He was then charged with being a member of the outfit and a case was registered. Journalists in the State say that he was arrested on fabricated charge  he was a member of the banned group. The case brings out the fact that journalists face threats from both sides. While underground groups resort to violence to force the media to publish their statements, the government is targeting the media for its role in exposing a fake encounter, says the union. Manipur newspapers have been facing severe pressure  including bomb threats, editors being held hostage and offices being ransacked  by underground groups who want their propaganda material published. The union has been talking to such groups to convince them of the need for a free press in a democratic set-up. The union says that it has been constrained to negotiate with banned outfits against the forced publication of their propaganda because of the failure of the State government to provide us a free and secured environment. For example, a KCP group had held six editors hostage in order to force the entire Imphal press to carry their statement. Another KCP group had ransacked Mr. Singh's office.

Joseph in Muvattupuzha. It was filed by K.M. Sabu Mathew, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Muvattupuzha, in the Ernakulam Sessions Court. The charge sheet said the accused PFI activists hatched a conspiracy to punish' Mr. Joseph, who had prepared a question paper for the B.Com students of Newman College, Thodupuzha, and which included what they considered an offensive question, regarding Prophet Mohammed and Islam.

When the professor returned in his car along with his sister Stella, a nun and his mother Elikutty after attending church, they stopped his vehicle, dragged him out and chopped off his hand. His mother and sister were also injured in the attack. The accused have been charged under sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 202 (intentional omission to give information of offence), 212 (harbouring offender), 307 (attempt to murder), 143 (unlawful assembly), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 120(B) (criminal conspiracy), 323 (causing hurt) and 153(A) (promoting enmity among different groups on religious grounds) of the India Penal Code.

Eshwarappa and Haliyal MLA Sunil Kumar Hedge. A CAT Bench comprising Vijay Kumar and Kathayaini passed the order on an application by S.B. Mallesha, Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF). Challenged  Mr. Mallesha had challenged his transfer from Haliyal to Virajpet. He had alleged that the only reason for his transfer was letters to the Chief Minister by the State BJP president and the local MLA. Mr. Mallesha's counsel, Gangadhar Sangolli, had produced letters by both Mr. Eshwarappa, and Mr. Hegde to Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyruppa, seeking the transfer of DCF Kantharaju from Virajpet to Haliyal. Mr. Sangolli submitted that the Cadre Managing Authority (CMA) had transferred his client only on the basis of the letters dated September 11 and September 15, 2010. He said political exercise of power as well as fraud of power had been committed by the respondents. The Bench ordered issue of notices to Mr. Eshwarappa and Mr. Hedge and adjourned further hearing of the case. Stayed A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice J.S. Khehar and Justice A.S.

The mosque was demolished on Wednesday on the direction of a court on a contempt of court petition filed by the Jangpura Residents' Welfare Association against the DDA for not complying with an earlier order of the court to demolish the mosque. In the compliance report filed by one of its officials, the DDA submitted that it had not violated the demolition order. However, if any act of omission or commission on its part was construed an infraction of the judgment, the DDA tendered an unqualified apology and prayed forgiveness, the report said. Noor Masjid's boundary wall and new tin shed were removed and thereafter the land measuring 350 sq. m. was reclaimed, the report said. It further said that fencing of the land and construction of a new boundary wall was in progress, and a sign board had been put up at the site reading DDA Land. The DDA urged the Court to dismiss the contempt petition in view of the demolition of the illegal mosque. Meanwhile, the Delhi Wakf Board filed and later withdrew a petition seeking modification of the demolition order, when a Division Bench of the Court comprising Justice Dipak Misra and Sanjeev Khanna said this court did not have the authority to hear the petition filed under the Delhi Wakf Act. The Bench suggested to the Board to approach the Wakf Tribunal, instead. The Board in its petition said that before a mosque was built on the site, it was a burial ground for Muslims. It said that the land belonged to it and hence the DDA should have approached it before demolishing the mosque. However, the petition was withdrawn when the Bench said that if something was found contrary to facts, the Court would impose a penalty of Rs.1 lakh on the Board.  OPEN",

According to a reliable source, the 11 firms include PRP Granites, which alone accounted for over Rs. 700 crore. Villages such as Keelavalavu, Keelaiyur, Saraguvalaipatti, Tiruvadavur, Thumbaipatti, Sivalingam, and Vellaloor have come under official scanner for various violations. Based on reports from Assistant Director (Mines), t Collector Anshul Mishra has instructed officials for recovery and issued notices under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. Explaining, the source said, Out of the 86 granite firms taken up for evaluation, work have been completed in 64 quarries. We have sent notices to 11 firms and steps are being taken to send such notices for recovery to others also. Further, the district administration had, in a letter to the State government, recommended suspension of mining licences to 52 granite firms so far and 34 more are pending in this connection. Huge loss Extensive investigations reveal that the operators, through illegal mining, had quarried more than the permitted levels causing loss to the tune of Rs. 16,000 crore to the exchequer. During the checks that went on for over three months since August, the officials unearthed illegally quarried stones from the stock yards of many operators. A senior official said, In today's market value, the confiscated stones are worth around Rs. 4,000 crore. The 11 firms, for whom notices have been sent, would have to cough up over Rs. 1,200 crore as the investigations pointed that they had allegedly stolen stones measuring a little over five lakh cubic metres. The other illegal firms also would receive similar notices shortly, the source said.  OPEN",

Justice M. Venugopal passed the ruling while allowing a revision petition filed by the wife of a pawnshop owner challenging an order passed by a judicial magistrate here on December 30, 2010 denying custody of gold jewellery and silver articles stolen from their shop but recovered later. The magistrate had refused to handover 8,879.380 grams of gold jewels, 1,278.100 grams of silver articles and 118.750 grams of gold plated jewellery despite the South Gate police in the city not objecting to the claim made by the petitioner Sikappi Aatchi whose husband Manickam Chettiyar (since dead) owned the pawn shop. Not finding force in the decision taken by the magistrate despite the police not objecting to the petitioners claim, Mr. Justice Venugopal said that there was no bar under criminal law for judicial magistrates to handover interim custody of jewels stolen from a pawnshop to the shop owner. Passing an order with regard to interim custody of the jewels would not amount to deciding the rights of the individuals concerned over the property.  OPEN",

The move was supported by China, Russia and mostly Arab states. At the last count, 89 countries had endorsed the global treaty on telecom regulations by Friday, with nearly 45 nations led by the United States, the U.K., the European Union, Japan, Australia and even Kenya, either refusing to sign or buying time to study the proposals. India, which initially backed the ITRs and the accompanying resolution during a sudden vote, later announced that it would sign the Treaty only after consultation with domestic stakeholders. It is now learnt that the matter will be discussed and approved by the Cabinet. Governments do not have to sign immediately and have until January 1, 2015 to ratify the Treaty. Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal has been steadfast in maintaining that he prefers a multi-stakeholder consensus-based process for Internet governance and no role for the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in content regulation. Since this move has larger ramifications, I believe the matter should be addressed by the Cabinet rather than just one ministry, Mr. Sibal told The Hindu . Trust Deficit During the week, the U.S. and European delegations demonstrated their concern over a related development, past midnight on Wednesday, when China, Russia and other allies succeeded in passing a resolution by a show of hands to include the Internet within the ambit of ITU outside the Treaty text. What started as an exercise to check the temperature of the delegates, resulted in the passing of a resolution with majority as announced by the WCIT Chair, Mohamed Nasser Al Ghanim, and Director General of the Telecom Regulation Authority of the UAE. Earlier in the week, a formal proposal by Russia and a secret UAE-led proposal supported by Russia and China surfaced, revealing these countries plans to bring the Internet under intergovernmental control through the ITU. Refusing to sign the Treaty, Ambassador Terry Kramer, head of the U.S. delegation, told a room full of 2,000 delegates from 193 countries, that the United States cannot sign the ITU regulations in its current form. Objections from countries which are refusing to sign the Treaty come on four counts. First, the inclusion of the Internet in the resolution, even though it is not a part of the binding text of the ITRs. Second, on Article 5B relating to unsolicited bulk electronic communication or spam which is seen as an open door to content regulation since spam is considered content. Third, lack of clarity on which agency or entities will be placed under the ITU regulations. And lastly, opposition to the fact that the ITU, an intergovernmental body, should not enter the Internet since it is better served through a transparent, bottom-up multi-stakeholder process. Review in India India said it supports the proposed ITRs and the Resolutions 1, 2, 4 and 5. We support the broad thrust of Resolution Plan 3 regarding an enabling environment for the greater growth of the Internet, particularly its recognition of the multi-stakeholder nature of the Internet and its wider social and economic impact within and across countries around the world. Buying time on directions from Mr. Sibal, India stated, We need to consider the wider ramifications of this Resolution before taking a decision on signing of the ITRs. We would therefore like to undertake necessary consultations at home before announcing our final decision. The need for a rethink arose after a call for a sudden vote led by Iran which took most countries by surprise since voting is seen as divisive on such fora. Especially since the move went against ITU General Secretary Dr. Toures multiple assurances, including a mid-conference Tweet on December 9, that, the key to the success of this conference is consensus.

Pattabhirama Rao was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau on Tuesday in connection with the bail scam involving the former Karnataka Minister, Gali Janardhan Reddy. He was remanded in 15 days judicial custody by Principal Special Judge for ACB & Special Police Establishment (SPE) cases S Jagannadham and ordered to be sent to the Charlapally jail. Mr. Rao was picked up from his residence here early in the morning and was shifted to the ACB headquarters at Mozamjahi Market. Thearrest was announced by the ACB around 2 p.m. He was produced before the judge after the customary medical check-up at the Osmania Hospital. After studying the medical report, the judge ordered that it be verified by the medical officer at Charlapally to decide whether he required any special medical treatment. Mr. Rao did not seek bail, his advocates on record said. Based on a CBI complaint, the ACB registered a case against Mr. Rao and seven others on June 9 and took up investigation for offences such as criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct in granting bail to Mr. Reddy. After conducting searches at various places, the ACB arrested the retired judge, T.V. Chalapathi Rao, and Mr. Rama Rao's son Talluri Ravi Chandra. Both were remanded in judicial custody. The ACB, in its FIR, said a deal was struck between Mr. Reddy and others, including the judge, for granting bail to the former Minister in the illegal mining case. The CBI had recovered Rs. 1.60 crore in cash from bank lockers belonging to Mr. Rama Rao and another Rs. 1.14 crore from the possession of T. Balaji Rao, brother of Mr. Chalapathi Rao.

Speaking to reporters in the hospital, Laxmi said that she was kept in an isolated room and hospital employees abused her and allegedly beat her for taking up the issue with the media. She demanded that her infant was given to her, so that she could leave the hospital. Earlier, tension prevailed in the premises, when members of women association and Democratic Youth Federation of India demanded that action be taken against the employee who demanded Rs. 1,000 for the delivery, and for allowing her husband, Samuel (30), to be with her in the maternity ward. But the hospital administration said that men would not be allowed inside and asked members of the women association to be with her. Earlier in the morning, a team, led by Dean Dr. R. Vallinayagam and Resident Medical Officer Geetha David, conducted an inquiry with the doctors and staff nurses who were on duty on Sunday night. Laxmi was asked to identify the woman who demanded money from her. But the woman could not be identified. Dr. Vallinayagam said that another inquiry would be conducted with employees and sanitary workers and if the person could not be identified, a compliant would be lodged with the police stating that an unauthorised person had entered the ward and demanded money from the patient.

Sources say that fire was put out by 8.45 p.m. It will not affect the land filling operations as the place of fire was at the southern end of the dumped waste. They say that the Corporation was keeping an eye on the waste even as it was processing and shifting the waste to the landfill. The previous fire at the Vellalore dump yard was about a couple of months ago. It was a major accident as the fire raged for over two days.

Justice V. Periya Karuppiah ordered transfer of investigation following a criminal original petition filed by A. Saibunissa, maternal grandmother of the deceased children. She claimed that the Vadipatti police had not taken constructive steps to arrest three prime culprits who flew to Malaysia after murdering the trio due to previous enmity with her son-in-law. The petitioner's counsel Veera Kathiravan said that his client's daughter A. Adila Banu of Ramanathapuram district had married a ration shop employee Muthusamy. A Dalit by birth, he later converted to Islam and renamed himself as Ahamad. The couple had two children, a boy and a girl aged seven and five. A few years later, her son-in-law took up a job in Malaysia. After his departure, one of his former colleagues met the petitioner's daughter and grandchildren and took them in his car in the guise of getting them a free cooking gas cylinder. A day later, the petitioner lodged a complaint with the Kenikarai police station in Ramanathapuram regarding the missing trio. Two days thereafter, their bodies were found near Vadipatti in Madurai district. Investigations revealed that the murder had been committed at the behest of an individual who was inimical against Ahamad for turning out to be a hostile witness in the murder case of the former's brother-in-law. The police also found out that three main accused had fled to Malaysia immediately after executing the murder with the help of hooligans who disposed of the dead bodies in the culvert. It is a gruesome murder in which innocent children have been done to death due to alleged previous enmity between two families. In such circumstances, this court is very much convinced that the CB-CID would be the competent agency to continue the investigation and complete the same after taking the assistance of the Malaysian police to bring the culprits back to India, Mr. Justice Periya Karuppiah said.

The All-Manipur Working Journalists' Union said in a statement that Mr. Singh received a call from someone claiming to be a member of the banned armed group, the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), on December 28. He wanted to set up a meeting with three members of the union, of which Mr. Singh is the spokesman and vice-president, to discuss issues relating to the publication of KCP's statements. When the supposed KCP member said that the meeting would be held in New Delhi, Mr. Singh said that the union had no fund for such travels. The agent then offered to foot the bill and said he would send the required funds. The next morning two Manipur police commandos in civilian dress came to his office on Sega Road in a rickshaw and asked him to collect the money. When he came near the duo, he was manhandled and taken to custody, said the statement. He tried to fight them off thinking them to be insurgents, but later they identified themselves as police commandos. The statement also alleges that the police seized Rs. 50,000 which they brought with them, and Rs. 2,000 from Mr. Singh. He was then charged with being a member of the outfit and a case was registered. Journalists in the State say he was arrested on a fabricated charge  he was a member of the banned group. The case brings out the fact that journalists face threats from both sides. While underground groups resort to violence to force the media to publish their statements, the government is targeting the media for its role in exposing a fake encounter, says the union. Manipur newspapers have been facing severe pressure  including bomb threats, editors being held hostage and offices being ransacked  by underground groups who want their propaganda material published. The union has been talking to such groups to convince them of the need for a free press in a democratic setup. The union says it has been constrained to negotiate with these outfits against the forced publication of their propaganda because of the failure of the State government to provide us a free and secured environment.

        "content": " Even as it embarks on a mission to transform itself into a force that can deliver a more lethal punch, the Army plans to set up a vigilance mechanism to carry out internal audits. Chief of the Army Staff General V.K. Singh on Friday said they were considering a vigilance mechanism that could conduct internal inspection at the right time. He asserted that the Army was taking suo motu action in cases of wrong-doings. He pointed out that such acts were committed by only a few people. However, action was being taken to ensure that the force did not lose faith in the chain of command. Gen. Singh said the Army was capable of meeting any threat, on one front or two fronts simultaneously. An expert committee was examining a proposal to transform the force by restructuring and reorganising it, including the headquarters. The idea is to be more agile and ensure that the organisation becomes more lethal in the punch it can deliver, he said at his customary press conference on Friday, eve of the Army Day. On operational issues, the Army Chief felt the force did not envisage reduction of troops in Jammu and Kashmir since the deployment on the Line of Control and International Border were as per requirement to ensure peace and deny terrorists space. On the announcement of the Home Ministry that there was a plan to reduce troops in the State, he said the term security forces includes police and para-military and any cut would have to be in consultation with the Unified Command. This was to make sure that the move did not result in extra pressure on the already stretched deployment of forces in the State. Vouching for the efficacy of the anti-infiltration plan in the State, he said the system resulted in forces killing 40 militants and foiling 95 infiltration attempts last year. The Army also plugged the gaps based on the infiltration pattern. On allegations of fake encounters in the Kashmir Valley, he said an inquiry report on the Macchil incident was awaited. On reports of transgression on the border with China, he said they were due China's perception of the Line of Actual Control, as the boundary was not clearly demarcated. Mechanisms were in place to take up issues through flag meetings so that peace and tranquillity was maintained on the border.   OPEN",

According to a sting operation conducted by a private television channel, a few professors allegedly allowed students to rewrite the M.Com papers by taking a bribe of Rs. 10,000 for each paper. The matter came to light after it was broadcast on Saturday. According to sources, a few professors allegedly struck a deal with M.Com students, assuring them that they would be given a chance to rewrite their answers provided they gave Rs. 10,000. Once the student writes the answer paper in the respective examination hall, the papers are sent to the decoding department in the university. The staff, before decoding the paper, allowed the students to once again write the paper and even provided them with the right answers. Interestingly, the students were even given the privilege of taking the papers to their rooms and writing, said a source who witnessed the sting operation. The footage showed a professor striking a deal with an M.Com student and after accepting the bribe, allowing him to write the paper again. Action will be taken When the matter was brought to the notice of Vice-Chancellor H.B. Walikar, he said he was unaware of the incident. He, however, said stringent action would be taken against the persons involved.  OPEN",

        "content": " Three former Ministers and activists on farmers' issues have described the verdict of the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)-II as a death blow and grave injustice to the farmers of Krishna delta, and vowed to exert pressure on the State government to represent the issue before the tribunal once again. Even as they gave a call for launching a united fight keeping political differences at bay to safeguard the interests of farmers of Andhra Pradesh, the former Ministers asserted that TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu was squarely to blame for the verdict because it was during his regime in the State and when his party was supporting the Deve Gowda government at the Centre that Karnataka raised the height of Almatti dam. Mr. Naidu also ignored the persistent demand for taking up Pulichintala and Polavaram projects, they alleged. The former Ministers  Mandali Buddha Prasad, Devineni Rajasekhar (Nehru) and Pinnamaneni Venkateswara Rao  addressed a press conference arranged under the banner of AP Jalayagna Sadhana Samithi and Krishna Delta Parirakshana Samithi. Kisan Service Organisation general secretary Akkineni Bhavani Prasad, Samatha Party former president V.V. Krishna Rao, AP Jalayagna Sadhana Samithi president Kolanukonda Sivaji and MLC Ilapuram Venkaiah were among those who conveyed their apprehensions about the adverse fallout of the verdict at the press conference. A meeting has been convened on Sunday by the Krishna Delta Parirakshana Samithi with representatives of all political parties and farmers to chalk out a future course of action, they said. Mr. Bhavani Prasad wanted the State government to question the basis on which the KWDT-II had delivered its verdict as it took only 65 per cent dependability of water calculated by taking 47-year-flood flow into consideration. This was against the recommendation of the second Irrigation Commission that recommended taking 75 per cent dependability. Mr. Buddha Prasad said the verdict did not give any direction to the upper riparian states to release water so as to make it available to the Krishna delta during June-July when nurseries would be raised. AP would lose heavily only on account of the disunity among political parties, which was not the case in Tamil Nadu or Karnataka. He called upon all MPs of the State to raise their voice keeping regional differences aside for a while, as all the three regions would stand to lose because of the verdict.Mr. Krishna Rao said the tribunal did a plain mathematical calculation without adopting a humanistic approach.

Addressing a press conference in Bangalore, Ms. Ranjitha described the entire video tape episode as a perverted move by certain vested interests, including politicians. Claiming that she had been made a scapegoat because she was a celebrity, the actor said had started visiting the Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam on the outskirts of Bangalore a little over a year ago after she was impressed by the yoga, meditation and other spiritual activities taking place in the ashram. Hurt by report Ms. Ranjitha, who appeared before the media at a wedding hall on Magadi Road in the city along with her advocates, said she had seen all clippings that were aired in television channels. I and my family have been hurt by the media reports, she said. Reacting to the Hyderabad-based Forensic Sciences Laboratory report that the video was genuine, Ms. Ranjitha said she cannot go by the FSL reports. I know that the woman in the tapes was not me. Threat calls Referring to reports in a section of the media that she was absconding, Ms. Ranjitha said she was a woman with ordinary fears and had been receiving threatening calls from vested interests, who were behind the entire episode. Hence, I took time to appear before the media and lodge a complaint. Besides, the actor said she was abroad between March 3 and June 14. After my return, I met Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officials and completed the pending investigation process. Fielding queries from journalists, Ms. Ranjitha alleged that a Christian missionary and some vested interests, including politicians were behind the entire episode. I was threatened not to speak about the tapes. Vested interests have been threatening me not to divulge any information. She offered to reveal everything to the media only if Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi ensured her security. I want to live for some more years. Hence, I am not revealing the names of the people who are behind the incident. If Mr. Karunanidhi assures me security against the threat, then I can disclose the details. If time permits and if Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam in Bidadi agrees, I will attend Nithyananda's birthday on Saturday, she said. Complaint Earlier on Thursday evening, the actor lodged a complaint against Nithayananda's driver Lenin Karuppan, a former follower Arathi Rao and an advocate Sridhar in the Ramanagaram court under several sections of Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation, extortion and bid to outrage the modesty of a woman. The hearing was adjourned to January 29, 2011. Meanwhile, another woman follower of Nithyananda has also filed a complaint against Lenin Karuppan.  OPEN",

Murder cracked The West Division police claim to have cracked the June 6 murder where Mahadeva (23) was hacked to death on Siddaiah Puranik Road. The Basaveshwaranagar police announced the arrest of Anil Kumar (27), Manju alias Cadbury (27), Lokesh alias Loki (24) and Sunil Kumar (23) and said they seized lethal weapons allegedly used to execute the crime. In their confessions, the suspects said Lokesh had borrowed Rs. 10,000 from Praveen, a friend of Mahadeva. When he failed to return the money, Praveen started harassing and insulting him. Lokesh allegedly ganged up with his friends and fooled Praveen into believing that he would return the money if he met him on Siddaiah Puranik Road. When Praveen arrived, he was assaulted by Lokesh and his gang. Mahadeva, who was with Praveen, tried to intervene but was stabbed.

More than 580 people are confirmed to have lost their lives. Besides, another 5,474 people who are still missing are feared to be no more, Defence Minister A.K Antony said in the Lok Sabha. Describing the disaster as one of unprecedented magnitude, he said 1.1 lakh persons were evacuated to safer places in the shortest possible time, notwithstanding widespread destruction of roads, difficult terrain and extremely hostile weather. Providing details of the measures taken by the State, Centre, and the Armed and paramilitary forces in rescue and rehabilitation efforts, Mr. Antony said the Air Force had rescued 23,775 people, the Army 38,750 and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 33,000 from affected areas. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had announced assistance of Rs.1,000 crore for immediate relief and rehabilitation during his visit to Uttarakhand on June 19, of which the Centre has already released Rs.400 crore. Mr. Antony said additional funds would be released by the Centre depending on the requirement of the State. He was countered by the BJP, which alleged that the funds had not reached Uttarakhand yet. It had been decided that the Uttarakhand issue would be the first to be taken up for discussion in the House, the Speaker said.  The Defence Minister also mentioned five IAF personnel, nine of the National Disaster Response Force, and six ITBP personnel, besides two pilots, who had lost their lives in a helicopter crash during rescue operations. The region will long remember the heroic commitment and courage displayed by our armed forces and police forces, as well as a large number civilian officials, residents and tourists who contributed towards rescue operations , he said.

        "content": " Searching for a black cat in a dark room is the definition that police officers give for investigating into complaints of missing persons. Complaints of missing persons are proving to be a major challenge for the police machinery. In the absence of a specific legal provision for registering a case based on a complaint about missing person, the police register a First Information Report saying man/women/girl/boy missing and of late, the courts do accept these FIRs. A cursory glance of the statistics reveals that aged persons, either out of frustration or out of depression or anger, leave their homes. In some cases, the boy or girl leaves the house owing to a love affair and fearing parental or peer group resistance. And then there are cases of mentally challenged persons and senior citizens suffering from Alzheimer's leaving the house and losing their way. There have been instances of such persons being traced after several years at places of religious importance. While efforts are made to trace them, even in the absence of a legal provision, there is a compulsion for the police to register an FIR stating missing. This is done because in certain cases, instances of missing persons being either found dead under suspicious circumstances or even murdered have come to light. In this eventuality, the FIR is altered to section 174 (found dead under mysterious circumstances) or 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. Ransom But when there is a demand for ransom immediately after the person goes missing, then the police register a case of kidnap or abduction for ransom under provisions i.e., from sections 359 to 366 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). When a person is reported missing, police suspect abduction or kidnap if the family has had any personal enmity or business rivalry. In the absence of demand for ransom due to enmity, then the case becomes really difficult to crack. In some cases, the families of the missing persons do not bother to inform the police once they are traced or return on their own without police help. This poses a big problem for the police since it leads to spiralling number of unresolved cases. But, the law insists that the missing person be produced before the court and declared as traced' or returned'. Based on his statement, the case file is closed, police officers said. As soon as a missing person's complaint is received, the police immediately alert their counterparts in neighbouring districts and also run a check at the government mortuaries for unclaimed bodies. When an unidentified body, with death under suspicious circumstances, is reported in nearby places, the police take a call with their counterparts to check whether the body was that of the person who had gone missing, officers who had investigated such complaints, pointed out. In addition, the police also issue handouts with photographs to the media for publication or broadcast, and seek information from the public about the person. Police usually step up their efforts if the missing person is a minor boy or girl. In such cases, the police ensure that the missing minor boy or girl is not kidnapped and maimed to force them into organised beggary. Such cases merit greater focus since there could be child trafficking involved. Similarly, in cases of missing adolescent girls, police step up efforts to prevent immoral trafficking.  OPEN",

A Bench of Justices Markandey Katju and Gyan Sudha Misra, in an order on a dispute involving two brothers, said: lawyers should advise their clients to try for mediation to resolve disputes, especially where relationships like family and business relationships are involved. Otherwise, litigation drags on for years and decades often ruining both the parties. The Bench quoted a passage from Mahatma Gandhi's book My Experiments with Truth, which said: I saw that the facts of Dada Abdulla's case made it a very strong indeed, and that the law was bound to be on his side. But I also saw that the litigation, if it were persisted in, would ruin the plaintiff and the defendant, who were relatives and both belonged to the same city. No one knew how long the case might go on. Should it be allowed to continue to be fought out in court, it might go on indefinitely and to no advantage of either party. Both, therefore, desired an immediate termination of the case, if possible. The Bench said, Hence, the lawyers as well as litigants should follow Mahatma Gandhi's advice in the matter and try for arbitration/mediation. This is also the purpose of Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the instant case between B.S. Krishnamurthy and B.S. Nagaraj, the Bench said this is a dispute between brothers. In our opinion, an effort should be made to resolve the dispute between the parties by mediation. The court referred the matter to the Bangalore Mediation Centre. The Bench directed the parties to appear before it on February 21. It directed the matter to be listed for further hearing after receiving a report from the centre.

The SIT was formed after Mr. Mani made a controversial statement in one of his speeches, claiming that a list of 13 political opponents was prepared to be killed. During investigations done by the SIT, four murders that occurred in Idukki were found to have links to this statement. Background Mr. Mani was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the case registered for murder of Anchery Baby, a Youth Congress leader who was shot dead on November 13, 1982. The SIT is also probing the murder of Mullanchira Mathai (beaten to death in January 1983), Muttukad Nanappan (stabbed to death in June 1983) and Balu (hacked to death in 2004). Some of these cases, including that of Anchery Baby murder, were tried and accused were acquitted for the want of evidence, while the case for murdering Balu had five persons convicted and are presently serving sentence at the Open Prison, Thiruvananthapuram. Mr. Mani, along with other top CPI (M) leaders from Idukki, was earlier questioned in connection with the case. But the SIT went for arrests, as none of these leaders concurred with the controversial speech and hence custodial interrogation was required. It is learnt that the SIT will seek the custody of Mr. Mani on Thursday. Mr. Mani and three others  O.G. Madanan, A.K. Damodaran and Kuttan  were given a chance to consent for polygraph test and also to exhaust all legal measures to avoid arrest. Pleas made by Mr. Mani to challenge the SIT move to register new FIR against him were turned down at the Kerala High Court and Supreme Court. In a clinically executed operation, the SIT had made elaborate arrangements before moving in for the arrest. Additional forces were kept ready to prevent any possible law and order issue, but they were asked to stay beyond the district borders till 5 a.m. Only top officials of the SIT were in the know of the exact action plan of the operation. After interrogating Mr. Mani in detail, the SIT is expected to take him around to scenes of crime. It is learnt that the SIT has got solid leads into cracking these cases, which happened nearly 30 years ago.   OPEN",

        "content": " Yet another instance of terror funding through the supply of party pills has surfaced, with the seizure of 160 kg of precursor pseudoephedrine tablets by the Delhi Police Special Cell, believed to be intended for supply to units operating in Myanmar, which reportedly manufacture party pills like ice to cater to a huge demand in the international market. Three persons, including an alleged conduit of a Manipur-based banned outfit, have been arrested. The initial information on the narco-terror network were received by the Special Cell sleuths, when they learnt that some persons from Manipur were smuggling narcotics, particularly the precursor chemical to methamphetamine, which is commonly known as party pill meth, ice, or crystal. Investigations by a team comprising three inspectors revealed that the consignments were being supplied allegedly at the instance of Khumanba, a top commander of the banned terror outfit Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup of Manipur. He was allegedly controlling the supply chain through one John Lalmingthanga (35), who the police learnt had stocked a large consignment at a Janakpuri flat in West Delhi. The narcotic and controlled substances were being stored and transported for supply to Myanmar and China via Manipur, said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell), Sanjiv Yadav. Acting on information that John would hand a consignment to an accomplice at Janakpuri, the police laid a trap on Thursday and arrested him, along with one Ashem Danny Singh (32). We seized from them pure pseudoephedrine in the form of tablets in five cardboard boxes, weighing more than 100 kg, said Mr. Yadav. At their instance, the police raided the storehouse and seized seven lakh more tablets, weighing 60 kg, each containing 80 per cent of the precursor chemical, besides shipping material and 10 bags of empty bubble foil for the pills. The third accused, named Lalawmpuia (27), was also arrested. John, an ex-serviceman from Assam Rifles, who belongs to Manipur, had been living in Safdarjung Enclave. He quit his job in 2008, shifted to the Capital, and started dealing in second-hand vehicles, and also ran some food-stalls. In due course, he got initiated into the party pill trade at the instance of a cousin, who is also allegedly into such trafficking business in Manipur. His accomplice, Ashem, also from Manipur, earlier worked as a teacher at home. He shifted to Delhi in 2002, and allegedly started working as a tout, facilitating government contracts for his clients. John allegedly took him into the business in September, to exploit his contacts with party pill distributers in Delhi. The accused, Lalawmpuia, who belongs to Mizoram, worked at a call centre in neighbouring Gurgaon, and had provided his rented accommodation to John to stock the consignments, said the police. Mr. Yadav said the accused were procuring the consignments from pharmaceutical factories in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi through local distributors. The pills were reprocessed to extract pure pseudoephedrine, which was transported to Myanmar for the manufacturing of methamphetamine, he added.

Viswanathan on Friday said that educational institutions and senior students are equally responsible for incidents of ragging. Mr.Viswanathan, along with Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Hema Karunagaran, was addressing heads of 52 educational institutions to sensitise them on the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Ragging Act of 1997 and the guidelines of the Supreme Court. Anti-ragging committees Mr.Viswanathan exhorted the heads of educational institutions to form anti-ragging committees and ensure strict vigil in the campus. Failure to prevent ragging or to report the same to the police for initiating legal action would result in the long arm of the law catching up with the educational institutions as well, he said. Commissioner said that failure to prevent, report or act on incidents of ragging will be deemed as abetment of an offence of ragging. Similarly, senior students who indulge in ragging will be dealt with severely. Section 4 of Tamil Nadu Prevention of Ragging Act will be invoked against the accused student as well as the head of the institution. The law prescribed a rigorous imprisonment of two years and a fine of Rs. 10,000. The accused students will be barred from gaining any admission in any college on completion of the sentence and literally the career of the student was at stake, officials said. Mr.Viswanathan asked the teachers, management representative of institutions and students to report about ragging incidents to the police by dialling 100 for reaching the Police Control Room, sending SMS to 98431-00100 or by sending e-mail to copcbe@yahoo.com. In extreme cases where no action was taken on information given earlier, the City Police Commissioner could be personally contacted at 94440-00029.

        "content": " Moral turpitude means anything done contrary to honesty, modesty and good morals. The expression should be understood in the light of prevailing norms that is expected from a person. It should be interpreted in the widest possible manner while considering the conduct of a person convicted and sentenced, the Madras High Court has said citing the Supreme Court. The question before a Division Bench comprising Justices D. Murugesan and B. Rajendran was: Whether the conviction and sentence imposed on a bank employee under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (Dishonour of cheque) could be considered to be the conviction and sentence for an offence involving moral turpitude, thereby disentitling him from continuing as a union member and holding the post of its general secretary. M. Lakshmanan, who was the general secretary of the ICICI Bank Employees Union, Chennai, was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000 by the Judicial Magistrate, Alandur, in March this year. The Magistrate found that Mr. Lakshmanan, being a bank employee and knowing the law, had issued cheques to three individuals without maintaining sufficient balance. He had borrowed Rs.10 lakh each from three individuals. The bank union secretary filed a civil suit before the court. It alleged that as the appellant's services had been terminated, he could not be a union member. It also filed applications praying among other things for an interim injunction restraining the appellant from functioning as the union general secretary. A single Judge allowed the applications. Hence, the present appeals. In its judgment dismissing the appeals, the Bench said the appellant had been convicted and sentenced. It did not accept the argument that the criminal court's judgment had been questioned by Mr. Lakshmanan and the sentence had been suspended and thereafter the judgment could not be relied. It said pending appeal alone, the sentence had been suspended and not the conviction. So long as the conviction remained, the judgment could be the basis for granting injunction. That apart, the single Judge had granted the injunction not only on the basis of mere conviction, but also considering other factors. As far as the claim for disqualification of the appellant from being a union member and consequently its general secretary, the Bench said the union had made out a prima facie case and for that reason alone, the single Judge had granted the interim order. That apart it was the bank's specific case that in view of the conviction, the appellant had been dismissed applying the relevant provisions of the Banking Regulation Act. On the given facts of the case, the Bench said it did not find the single Judge's reasoning as arbitrary. It made it clear that whatever the findings rendered in its order would be only for disposal of the appeals. The interim applications and the findings could not be construed as conclusive restricting the right of the parties to canvass their stand in the pending civil suit.  OPEN",

        "content": " Scarring is a major source of morbidity in patients with burns. Burn scars cause both functional and cosmetic problems. Besides being disfiguring, burn scars also cause pain, burning, itching, decreased function and reduced range of motion. Effective reconstructive surgery is, thus, of paramount importance to the patients quality of life. The long-term care seeks to optimise the functional and aesthetic outcome. Types of burns  The severity and type of scarring depends on the degree of burn. Several factors including the persons age, size and depth of the burn determine severity. Generally, burns are categorised by their depth in degrees from one to three. First degree burns cause minimal damage and affect only the epidermis or the surface layer. It causes pain, redness and swelling. With proper treatment, it is possible to prevent scars. In such cases, flush or soak the wound and cover it with a sterile non-adhesive bandage to protect it from friction or pressure. A second degree burn affects the outer layer (epidermis) and the underlying layer (dermis) and causes redness, pain, swelling and blisters. These also affect sweat glands and hair follicles. A moist sterile bandage should be placed over the wound. Do not apply cold water, compresses or ointment and make sure the burn area stays clean. A third degree burn affects the epidermis, dermis and hypodermis causing either charring or a translucent white colour, with coagulated vessels visible just below the skin surface. These burns are so deep that they damage the skin tissue and often leave the skin feeling numb. Treat third degree burns like second degree while getting the person to a medical professional as quickly as possible.  Home remedies for burns, especially from boiling water and oil, need to be administered quickly. Honey is commonly used for burns. Covering the burns with honey helps reduce scarring. Another remedy often used for first degree burns is diluted vinegar. Cover the injured area with a clean cloth soaked in diluted vinegar. It is usually painless but, if it starts to pain, change the bandage. Treatment  For a minor burn, hold the area under cool running water as the first step of treatment. In case of blistering, the cool water will take away the pain. Cover the area with a clean and sterile cloth. Do not apply any ointments, butter or oil. A good home remedy to remove scars is to gently massage the area with almond oil. A twice a day massage will help reduce the scar. Another method is to use fenugreek seeds. Soak fenugreek seeds in water overnight. The next morning, grind the seeds into a fine paste and apply gently on the mark and leave it on. Once the paste dries off, wash it off with water. Apply this paste regularly to remove the scars. Fresh lemon or tomato juice is also very effective. Lemon juice has acidic properties that naturally lighten the scars. Freshly squeezed tomato juice is another natural bleaching agent. First wash the burn area in cool water. Place a damp washcloth on the burn mark. Keep some fresh lemon juice ready. Moisten another washcloth with the lemon juice and dab gently on the mark. This will help cleanse the skin and lighten the scar. Once this is done, apply fresh tomato juice on the mark. Repeat twice a day to get rid of the mark in a few days. Colloidal silver is another healing agent with antiseptic properties. It also helps damaged tissue regenerate. Major hospital burn units use colloidal silver bandages and ointments. Severe burns often heal with little or no scarring.  OPEN",

At about 6 p.m., a tanker of ammonia gas burst inside an ice factory. Five persons, who had fallen sick due to inhalation of fumes, had to be rushed to the B. N. Bose Hospital, but one person, Babar Ali, an employee, was declared brought dead when he was taken to the hospital, said Gopal Bhattacharya, Director of the State's Fire and Emergency Services.

Locality affected Several others including people living in the vicinity were rushed to the Barasat Hospital and other hospitals in the vicinity after they complained of uneasiness. Altogether about 35 were affected, it was learnt. Help was also sought from the Air Force Camp nearby which has expertise in domestic fires, grass fires and electrical fires arising out of aircraft accidents. However since this appeared to be a case of fire caused by suspected ammonia gas leak, the Air Force could not be of any assistance, officials said.

According to the police, one Kumarveer had gone to his brother Pappus house in Harsh Vihar around 9 p.m. on November 13. From there he took Pappus four-year-old son Sonu along with him without informing the boys parents. Pappu then lodged a complaint and a case of kidnapping was registered. Later, Pappu received a call from Kumarveer who demanded a ransom of Rs 10 lakh for the release of the boy. Kumarveer and two of his accomplices, who had taken Sonu to a village in Bareilly, then asked Pappu to come to the Chandausi railway station with the money. As Pappu reached Chandausi, the kidnappers asked him to board a train bound for Bareilly. When he rejected their demand on the directions of a police party accompanying him, the kidnappers left the station and went back to Bareilly, said a senior police official. The police used technical surveillance to trace the phone number used to make the call for ransom and it was found to be in Bareilly from where a police team arrested one Bhoore Shah, who allegedly assisted Kumarveer in carrying out the kidnapping. On interrogation, Bhoore Shah purportedly told the police that Kumarveer and Noor Bano (Bhhore Shahs wife) had left the village for Delhi. As per their new plan, Kumarveer called his brother to the Shahdara railway station to collect the ransom amount. The police laid a trap at the railway station and arrested Kumarveer when he reached the station along with the kidnapped boy. Sonu was rescued and reunited with his family. Meanwhile Noor Bano who had left Bareilly along with Kumarveer de-boarded the train at Moradabad and is still at large. A search for her is on, said the police.  OPEN",

The 85-kg courier is worth Rs.4 crore in the international market. In the early hours of Wednesday, the CISF personnel scanning the baggage of passengers detected an object suggesting that some narcotic substance had been kept in two bags. On physical examination, they seized 85 kg of tablets that when tested using a narcotic substance kit turned out to be pseudo-ephedrine. The CISF subsequently detected four of the passengers. They were identified as Lalparmawia (30), who is in the 3rd Assam Regiment of the Indian Army from Shillong in Meghalaya, besides Vin Ramdingngheta (27), David Lalnuntluanga (23) and Ramdim (22 yrs) from Mizoram. During interrogation, they disclosed that they were on their way to board a flight to Kolkata from where they were going to Aizawl. The four had stayed at Janakpuri in West Delhi. Three of the accused worked in call-centres. The value of the recovered drugs is Rs.68 Lakh in India and Rs.4.08 crore in the international market, said a CISF spokesperson, adding that the Narcotics Control Bureau had confirmed that the seized tablets were pseudo-ephedrine. The accused have been handed over to the NCB for further action. During the past few weeks, the CISF along with other agencies has detained 13 persons and seized over 300 kg of pseudo-ephedrine.

They were all riding a motorbike.On Monday morning, residents of Pink City and elsewhere woke to heart-rending images of the young man crying out for help, with his weeping son at his side and wife and daughter lying in a pool of blood next to him, as vehicles passed on by. Kanhaiyalal, his wife Guddi (26), five-year old Tanish and 6-month-old Arushi were on their way to Luniyawas village, the womans maternal home, for a religious function when the tragedy occurred. As the four of them, Arushi in her mothers lap on pillion and Tanish on the fuel tank, entered the tunnel from Jawahar Nagar side, they had no idea it was to be their last family outing together. Three hundred metres into the tunnel, Kanhaiylals bike was hit by the truck from behind as he tried to overtake another truck ahead of him. While he and the boy fell on the footpath, Guddi and Arushi fell to the other side, and came under the wheels of the overtaking truck. Passersby came to his aid only when, after having struggled in vain to seek help, Kanhaiyalal fainted. Since the tunnel has no mobile signal reception, the distraught man could not call anyone for help. Two-wheelers are not allowed inside the tunnel. When asked about regulation, Deputy Commissioner of Traffic Lata Manoj Kumar said, We have managed to trace the truck that hit them and will catch the driver soon. The traffic police have fined over 3,000 violations in the tunnel, most of them involving entry of two-wheelers. We have contributed to [the regulation of] such incidents since the first day. There is team of traffic policemen stationed in the tunnel, along with an interceptor vehicle, which is there 24 hours. But sometimes people manage to sneak in, said Ms. Kumar. Rohan Rajdeep Rajasthan Infrastructure Ltd., the company entrusted with the maintenance of the tunnel, has been passing the buck onto the traffic police regarding regulation of vehicles and other violations in the tunnel. More than the accident, it was the apathy of passersby that has shocked people.  OPEN",

        "content": " Responding to the call by various organisations, members of the Jat community in Haryana on Sunday began their march towards Delhi to blockade the national capital and press the Union, as well as the State governments, to concede their demand for reservation in government jobs and educational institutions. The two main organisations spearheading the agitation, Sarvjat Khap Aarakshan Samiti and Jat Aarakashan Sangharsh Samiti, have rejected the recent announcement by the Haryana government that claimed to have accepted the report by the Haryana Backward Classes Commission to recommend a 10 per cent reservation to the Jats and four other communities. These organisations have accused the State government of attempting to mislead the people through an eyewash. The Sarvjat Khap Aarakshan Samiti chief, Nafe Singh has said the announcement of the Haryana government contravened the Supreme Court ruling that reservations could not go beyond 50 per cent. He said 22 per cent reservation already existed for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) had accounted for 27 per cent reservation. He clarified that the Jats of Haryana had sought to be included in the 27 per cent category for OBCs. Providing details about the agitation, president of the Jat Arakashan Sangharsh Samiti Ram Bhagat Malik said activists from Rohtak, Hisar, Sirsa, Jind and Fatehabad, would blockade Delhi at Bahadurgarh; while those from Ambala, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat and Sonepat would picket at the Kundli border. Gurgaon side would be blocked from Gurgaon, Bhiwani and Bawal. Threatens blockade When reports last came in, protesters had begun using every means of transport to reach the assembly points. Both Mr. Singh and Mr. Malik said the protesters would prevent all vehicular and commercial transport from entering and leaving Delhi till their demands were met. They warned the government, which has rushed additional security forces to deal with the situation, from using force to disrupt the proposed peaceful protest by the Jats. Haryanas Brahmin Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti also announced to organise a statewide rath yatra from Monday to seek reservation for the community, which accounted at least 15 per cent of the States population and was backward.

Asked if police powers would be part of the formula, he categorically said, No It's not practical. Pointing to an incident where the aircraft of a top politician was not allowed to land in an Indian State, he said: We do not want such problems. The solution will be arrived at in consensus with all political parties depending on the proposals they make. Power sharing with the Centre is very much on the table. He said that once the Tamil parties and the government discussed the issues threadbare, the solution would also be discussed with the country, after which it could be fine-tuned for implementation. He reiterated what he had told The Hindu in an interview earlier: that he had a solution in mind, but was not in a position to reveal it. Mr. Rajapaksa said the rehabilitation process was continuing in the north and this was independent of demining activity. Asked for a time frame for demining to be completed, he said that it would take at least another six months. But this would not stand in the way of rehabilitation, he said. Only 7000 persons were left in the camps for the internally displaced. We want to send them out also. But they have nowhere to go, he said. Asked if most of the 50,000 houses being built would be new, he said that for now, the pilot project of building 1,000 houses had commenced. The work was on schedule. Asked if the recent observation of the Canada Immigration and Refugee Board  that merely because one is a Tamil, his or her life is not in danger  meant that the West was warming to Sri Lanka, President Rajapaksa said that there was a big change (in attitude) in the West. He referred to the arrest of elements of The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Switzerland and Germany to substantiate his view. On the rehabilitation of ex-LTTE cadres, he said over 5,000 had already been released. After 30 years of fighting terrorism, we were able to release them in as short a period as six months, which is not an easy feat. No other country has been able to achieve such success, he said. On the fate of the hardcore LTTE elements, he said that they would be charged on the basis of evidence. On the question of pardon to the former Army Commander, Sarath Fonseka, he said that everything had to follow due process.  OPEN",

        "content": " As part of the confidence building measures in Jammu and Kashmir, the Union government on Friday said it was contemplating reducing nearly 25 per cent of the security forces in the State. Home Secretary G. K. Pillai said it planned to unilaterally issue six-month multiple entry permits for the people of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) who intended to visit Jammu and Kashmir through the Line of Control (LoC). As a confidence building measure, the strength of the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir would come down by 25 per cent. We would like to reduce it as soon as possible depending on the ground situation, he said at a seminar at the Jamia Millia Islamia University here. Mr. Pillai said some forces had been taken out of Srinagar and 16 bunkers removed. It was an ongoing process. The deployment of security forces should be of minimum strength in populated areas and management by the local police would be the ideal situation. If there is no violence and if people are comfortable, we can gradually reduce the strength of security forces and make sure that all forces are only at the border and for preventing infiltration, he said. As part of the confidence building measures, India and Pakistan allowed people from Jammu and Kashmir and PoK to visit either side, with a permit valid for 15 days. We suggested that the people visit their relatives more often. If you give 15 days permit, they have to go through the verification process. So why don't we give a six-month multiple entry permit, we suggested. Once verification is done, one can visit relatives whenever he or she wants. Now we are planning to unilaterally give six-month multiple entry permits for the people of PoK, he said. Asked by a Kashmiri student why it took four months for the Centre to react to the deaths of students in Jammu Kashmir during last summer, Mr. Pillai admitted that it should not have taken so long, but added that governance is a huge issue for the Central government. Why can't the State government solve some issues on its own? At every stage the Centre is expected to fill in. You have to empower the people. The government has to be decentralised, has to reach out to people, he noted. The Centre was asking corporate India to give jobs to youth from Jammu and Kashmir in different parts of the country. We think they can absorb 1,00,000 youths in jobs all over India in the next 12 months, he said. Lauding the work of the three government-appointed interlocutors on Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Pillai said their interactions had encouraged people to speak out.  OPEN",

        "content": " With the Supreme Court coming down on the Centre and the Andhra Pradesh government for the alleged cold-blooded killing of Maoist spokesperson Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad and journalist Hemchandra Pandey, the authorities will finally be forced to answer the series of uncomfortable questions thrown up by an independent investigation into the encounter last year. While the State police claimed the alleged encounter with Azad and a large group of Maoists took place in the limits of the Wankadi police station of Adilabad district on the night of July 1, a fact-finding team constituted by the Coordination of Democratic Rights Organisations (CDRO) poked holes in the official account. The team, consisting of notable personalities including Supreme Court senior advocate Prashant Bhushan, opined that Azad was likely shot dead from a very close range, not more than a foot, rather than from a distance as the police said. The CDRO argued that the duo was killed with the knowledge of the Union Home Ministry as Azad was preparing for peace talks between the Centre and the Maoists at the initiative of social activist Swami Agnivesh. Referring to the post mortem report of Azad, the report raised doubts on the versions given by the police and pointed out:  the fatal bullet entry wound from the chest at the left 2nd intercestal space' had darkening burnt edges'. The burnt mark at the entry wound is a clear indication of a bullet being fired from a very close range (no more than a foot). The corresponding exit wound is at the ninth and tenth inter-vertebral space and depth is nine inches. That means the bullet entered from the upper chest and travelled downwards. This questions the police version that Maoists were on the top of the hill and they (police) were below, the team opined. The team, referring to the version of the police that they located the two unidentified bodies (which later turned out to be that of Azad and Pandey) only the next morning (July 2), wondered how the police were able to pinpoint the location of the Maoists in a forest of several hundred sq.km on the Andhra Pradesh-Maharashtra border. How come, despite 30 minutes of firing (11 to 11.30 p.m.), not a single policeman suffered any injury, whereas only Azad and Pandey were killed, the report asks. If there were 20 Maoists as stated in the FIR, why were they able to locate only two kit bags and two weapons. In any escapade there would be more belongings left behind. Similarly if the police were unaware of the identities of the two dead men till 9.30 a.m. on July 2 at the time of filing of the FIR, how did the electronic media learn by 6 a.m. on July 2 that Azad had been killed in an encounter? Several channels had also announced his death. So it clearly shows that the police knew who they had killed, the team said. The team wondered why the police selected Wankadi mandal for the encounter as the villagers clearly told us that in recent years there had been no Maoist activity in the region. Media reports at the time quoted human rights activists alleging that Azad and Pandey were picked up by the police at Nagpur on June 30 and brought to Andhra Pradesh in a helicopter and shot dead. They also mentioned that Azad was carrying a letter of Swami Agnivesh at the time of his arrest. Azad was a central committee member of the CPI (Maoist). Even Railway Minister and Trinamool Congress president Mamata Banerjee raised doubts on the death of Azad and demanded a judicial probe. There were pleas in this regard in Parliament too. But Home Minister P. Chidambaram rejected them, stating the issue was a State subject and it was for the Andhra Pradesh government to decide.  OPEN",

        "content": " The current political crisis has so paralysed the Congress leadership that it is finding it hard to institute the sort of sweeping changes it would like to see in both the party organisation and the government. Coping with soaring food prices, a slew of scams and a first class political crisis in Andhra Pradesh  not to mention the the electoral washout in Bihar  the party brass is barely living from day to day. More than three weeks after the Congress' 83 {+r} {+d} plenary ended, the apex decision making body, the Congress Working Committee is yet to be constituted, the list of All India Congress Committee delegates incomplete with Bihar and Tamil Nadu, among other States, yet to send in their names, and many of the State units without heads. Amidst all this confusion, speculation has been raging on changes in the Cabinet, with top party sources suggesting that the exercise could take place some time between Makar Sankranti and Republic Day. And the changes in the government and the party would follow each other, as some leaders might be asked to exchange jobs. But party sources are also saying that with the government at sixes and sevens and despite the desire to go in for a new-look administration, the maximum it might stretch to is to fill vacancies in the government: for instance, with the departure of Prithviraj Chavan for Mumbai, where he has become Chief Minister of Maharashtra, there is a key Minister of State slot to be filled in the Prime Minister's Office. Similarly, Kapil Sibal is carrying the burden of two full-time jobs, Human Resource Development and Telecom  so he could be divested of one of the portfolios. Earlier, top government sources told The Hindu that the Prime Minister was keen on moving out those he considered inefficient but that he was finding it very hard to do anything, given the current crisis. What is making it harder is that he himself is in the firing line, with the Opposition targeting him for not acting against the former Telecom Minister, A. Raja, earlier. With both the government and the party in crisis, a party functionary told The Hindu, Congress president Sonia Gandhi also wanted things to settle down before she made any change. Party sources added the one person, one post would generally be applied, but not very strictly  so while a minister may not double up as general secretary, he could be made in-charge of a State. In this context, for instance, Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad's name was taken: Mr. Azad is rapidly emerging as a party troubleshooter, first in Tamil Nadu, a State he is in charge of, and now in Andhra Pradesh, a State he is familiar with as he was once in charge of it. Meanwhile, the party's energies are being consumed in firefighting  countering the Opposition's efforts to pillory it for the scams, particularly the 2G spectrum matter, calming down its MPs from Telangana, strategising how to neutralise the former Kadapa MP, Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, while planning the Jan Jagran Abhiyan and for the five Assembly elections later this year. The government, on its part, is engaged in trying to control food prices, hoping the various enquiries into the range of scams will bring some closure, even as it is working on ensuring that the Opposition attends the budget session of Parliament. For if that is also a washout, like the winter session, the government's very credibility  even existence  will be at stake.  OPEN",

Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley spoke on the report, she said, adding, There cannot be one standard for those who accept it and one for those who criticise it. In a press release on January 12, the CAG had referred to Rules of Business, which, it said, prohibited any MP from making comments when a matter was being looked into by a parliamentary committee. Ms. Natarajan said she was surprised and distressed by the release because there was no such rule  she had meticulously pored through the various parliamentary rules as well as rulings given by the Speaker, but had not found the Rule 1.12 referred to by the CAG, she said. Surprised We are surprised and disturbed, Ms. Natarajan said, stressing, To suggest that MPs cannot speak is a strong suggestion from a constitutional authority. She also accused the CAG of leaking details of the report, which had begun to appear in newspapers from October 19, while the report was tabled in Parliament on November 16 last year. How was it leaked? How did the details come into the public domain? she asked. Making public comments on the matter which is being considered by a Parliamentary Committee is highly improper and may even amount to contempt of the House, the CAG's statement had said. Curiously, Ms. Natarajan's attack on the CAG, while in sync with that of her fellow spokesperson Manish Tiwari, who had trashed the CAG report a few days ago, came a day after another party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi had sought to tone down the party's criticism of the CAG.

When the S-G said the government had got the details but did not want to reveal them, Justice Reddy asked him: Why are you [Centre] reluctant to disclose the names. What is the difficulty in disclosing the information? What is the privilege you are claiming for not disclosing? Issues involved in this case are serious and of larger dimension. It is not only about tax avoidance but other issues are also involved. The Bench was hearing a petition filed by senior advocate Ram Jethmalani and others alleging inaction by the government in getting back the black money stashed away in foreign banks. The S-G submitted that he would take instructions from the government on whether the names could be disclosed or not and inform the court on the next date of hearing.

        "content": " Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy has moved the Supreme Court for a direction to the Central Bureau of Investigation to ensure that there was no interference in the 2G spectrum case probe, as he apprehended interference following the statement of Telecommunications Minister Kapil Sibal. Dr. Swamy submitted that Mr. Sibal held a news conference recently and it was carried by the media through the length and breadth of the country. He said it was evident from these reports that it was the Minister's considered view that there was little or no wrongdoing, and hence whatever had gone wrong could be set right with a small fine. Mr. Sibal criticised the approach of the Comptroller and Auditor-General (in estimating the loss to the nation by the illegal awarding of licences and the allocation of 2G spectrum) in a manner tantamount to ridiculing the CAG. He has even gone to the extent of issuing a veiled warning of a breach of secrecy on the part of the CAG, thereby intending to overawe an institution constitutionally empowered to oversee the finances of the government. Dr. Swamy said: Since the Supreme Court has directed monitoring of the CBI investigations into the criminal culpabilities in the 2G spectrum scam and specifically directed that the CBI take the said CAG report as a basis, it is apprehended that this intemperate and uncalled for public attack on the CAG methodology, before the national press and consequent extensive media publicity, may prejudice the CBI investigations and cause an obstruction to justice. There is, therefore, urgency to ensure that the said CBI inquiry is carried out without interference for which purpose the monitoring was directed by this court. Nothing must permit the slightest derogation from that objective. The government has already collected Rs.73.73 crore as penalty by way of liquidated damages for certain infractions of the issued licenses. The total money proposed to be collected [around Rs. 219 crore at the highest] amounts to not even 1per cent of even the most conservative estimates of what these licenses would have fetched in the open market. It is apprehended that further such adjudication by the respondent may be carried out pendente lite, thereby leading to further compounding of these and other further instances of infractions; and it is apprehended that by the payment of such compounding fees etc., rights to regularisation may be claimed by the defaulting licensees. And this may lead to further losses to the public exchequer. Dr. Swamy, whose main prayer in the main petition was for a direction for fresh auction of spectrum, wanted the court to direct that all such and further adjudication by the government be not carried out except under the supervision of the court; and that all such moves be subject to orders and final judgment of the court.

On seeing this, some of the CITU members tried to get into the building by jumping across the hand rails on the steps. When the ATP men protested against this, some of the CITU men reportedly attacked them with casuarina poles. Palani Corporation Transport Staff Society Deputy Secretary S. Thangavel alleged that an unruly mob, standing on the street, pelted stones on the building and on candidates waiting in a queue on the steps leading to the society office. Later, the situation turned worse as both parties pelted stones against each other. Many candidates suffered head injuries. The police rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control. Special Police Force was deployed on the society premises. Vehicular traffic was suspended for some time on the Railway Station Road. The police blocked the society entrance and allowed only candidates to enter the building to file nominations. Superintendent of Police T. Jayakumar, who monitored the proceedings, said the situation was brought under control.  OPEN",

Achuthanandan has said. Inaugurating the Road Safety Week observance at the Kanakakunnu palace here on Saturday, the Chief Minister said tipper lorries and other lorries were causing the maximum number of road accidents. The number of tipper lorries in the State had gone up from 5,200 in 2001 to over 40,000 in 2010. Pointing out that the vehicle population in the State had gone up from 21.5 lakh in 2000 to 53.5 lakh in 2010, Mr. Achuthanandan said it was impossible to develop roads commensurate to the increase in the number of vehicles that was hitting the road. This should be considered in chalking road safety programmes. One-fourth of those killed in road accidents were two-wheeler riders. Negligence, inexperience and rash driving often increased fatal accidents, he said. As many as 10 persons were getting killed road accidents in the State daily, although the number of road accidents was coming down marginally. The Chief Minister said the biggest challenge was finding a solution to it. The several initiatives taken by the Road Safety Authority had helped in bringing down road accidents. But, extraordinary steps were needed to further reduce accidents, he said. The Chief Minister said steps had already been taken by the Public Works Department to make 217 black spots in the State accident-free by initiating engineering measures. Speed tracers with cameras to check speeding, cameras in junctions to check traffic violations, signal jumping and mobile squads to check drunk driving and alcohol meters had been provided. Medical care Mr. Achuthanandan said the delay in giving timely medical aid was another reason for the mounting fatality in road accidents and a solution had to be found for that. The Chief Minister called for steps to make the process of issuing driving licence strict. The Chief Minister said road users should work together to bring down road accidents. Transport Minister Jose Thettayil, Education Minister M.A. Baby, Public Works Minister M. Vijayakumar, Actor Suresh Gopi, V. Sivankutty, MLA, and State Transport Commissioner T.P. Senkumar were present. Earlier, a procession was taken out by members of the Road Safety Club and Student Police Cadet from Manaveeyam Veedhi to the Kanakakunnu Palace.  OPEN",

        "content": " Union Minister for Rural Development Jairam Ramesh took an indirect dig at the State Government for not making available individual sanitary latrines or, at least, community toilets in spite of its tall claims on women empowerment. Mr. Jairam recalled his experience in Anantapur district recently where he accompanied Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to interact with self help groups. Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy and Minister N. Raghuveera Reddy made several claims on women empowerment including provision of basic amenities to them. But when asked for their views, seven out of 10 women in the gathering said they had no toilets and so they defecate in the open. This is the state of affairs in spite of the fact that a majority of these women are enrolled in the self help groups for over five years, he said. Mr. Jairam Ramesh was addressing the participants at the valedictory of a national conference on community based approaches for inclusive growth here on Saturday. The Minister announced the Centres decision to extend loans at seven per cent interest to SHGs from April 1 next year bringing them on a par with the farmers. The interest rate would be further reduced to four per cent in 150 districts selected on the basis of parameters like Dalit and population of tribal people and incidence of naxalites. In addition, the Centres decision to implement direct benefit transfer scheme would come in handy for the SHG women who could act as franchisees in reaching out the amounts to targeted beneficiaries. This is not a scheme where money is deposited in the accounts. It involves cash transfer and SHG women can utilise their network as banking correspondents for effective delivery of cash at the door steps, of course, charging some commission from the Government, he said. The State had registered 1,500 SHG women as franchisees to operate post office accounts and the model could be replicated in the banks too in the coming days. The Minister explained that the salient feature of the national rural livelihood mission project was to reach out to the grass roots for which the elected local bodies and the SHG groups formed two main pillars. The women, on their part, should make sure they did not confine themselves to financial issues and looked beyond to address social aspects like women trafficking, sanitation and manual scavenging still prevalent in some parts, he added. Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor K.C. Chakrabarti and others spoke, while city-based resource organisation APMAS chairman K. Madhava Rao presided over the valedictory address.  OPEN",

The JD(S) leader alleged that the RSS leader Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat was trying to create an atmosphere of fear in the coastal region in order to strengthen the roots of the BJP. This could not be allowed, he said. He said the reporter of Kasturi News 24, being run by his wife, was arrested within half an hour of his speech against Mr. Bhat in Sullia on November 7. The reporter (Naveen Soorinje) was being held in prison for more than a month as he had been denied justice from the BJP government, the police, and other institutions. Those who misused the law would have to regret in future, he said. Denying the Congress allegation that his party was responsible for bringing the BJP to power, he said his party had joined hands with it at a time when people had rejected the Congress and put in place a coalition government. He had to dump Congress as it was out to destroy the JD(S) and there was no option but to align with the BJP. The programme began nearly three hours behind the schedule. Yeddyurappa criticised Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the convention, Mr. Kumaraswamy ridiculed B.S. Yeddyurappa saying he had formed the Karnataka Janata Party only to escape from the law after having committed blunders. He told presspersons that the KJP did not have a vision for development. Mr. Yeddyurappa, who spoke of Basaveshwaras principles, had acted against them when he was in power.  OPEN",

        "content": " Editor of the Manipur daily Sanaleibak, A. Mobi Singh, was arrested this week by police commandos posing as representatives of a banned organisation. Manipur's embattled journalists say that the fabricated charges  that Mr. Singh was a member of a banned group  is simply the latest example of the threats they face from different sides. While underground groups resort to violence to force the media to publish their statements, the government is targeting the media for its role in exposing a fake encounter, says the All Manipur Working Journalists Union (AMWJU). According to a statement by the Union, Mr. Singh received a call from someone claiming to be a member of the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), a banned armed group, on December 28. He wanted to set up a meeting with three members of the AMWJU, of which Mr. Singh is spokesman and vice president, to discuss the publication of KCP's statements. Manipur newspapers have been facing severe pressure  including bomb threats, editors being held hostage and offices being ransacked  from underground groups who want their propaganda published. The AMWJU has been following a policy of talking to such groups whenever possible to convince them of the need for a free press in a democratic set-up. However, when the supposed KCP member said that the meeting would be held in New Delhi, Mr. Singh said that the AMWJU lacked funds for such travel. The KCP member offered to foot the bill and said would he send the required funds, according to the Union's statement. However, next morning, two Manipur police commandos in civilian dresses came to his office at Sega Road in a rickshaw and asked him to collect the money. When he came near the duo, he was manhandled and taken into custody, said the statement. He tried to fight them off thinking them to be insurgents but later they identified themselves as police commandos. The statement also alleges that the police seized Rs. 50,000 which they brought with them but never handed over to Mr. Singh, along with Rs. 2,000 from his personal purse. He was then charged with being a member of the outfit and a case was registered. Forced publication The AMWJU points out that it has been constrained to negotiate with banned outfits against the forced publication of their propaganda because of the failure of the State government to provide a free and secure environment. In the past, a particular KCP group had held six editors hostage in order to force the entire Imphal press to carry their statement. A KCP group had ransacked Mr. Singh's office. After newspapers refused to publish certain items in 2008, a banned group had placed a bomb in the office of the Sangai Express. The AMWJU statement blames the government and police for failing to take action in any of these cases. We believe the media in Manipur is being targeted by the State police for its apparent role in exposing the alleged fake encounter at BT Road on 23 July 2009, which is under CBI investigation and involved several police officers, said the statement, adding that a memorandum to the Union Home Minister urging action against the murder of an Imphal journalist was also being held against them.

        "content": " Will the New Year see another round of political uncertainty in Haryana? This is the question being asked in political circles here. The speculation has been triggered by the significant order passed by the Punjab & Haryana High Court directing the Vidhan Sabha Speaker to decide within four months a petition filed by Haryana Janhit Congress (BL) chief Kuldeep Bishnoi seeking disqualification of five HJC legislators who had joined the Congress in 2010 to lend crucial support to the Bhupinder Singh Hooda regime. Whatever the outcome of the High Court order and whether the Speaker accepts it or not, the main Opposition party, the Indian National Lok Dal, has started activating its cadres and frontal organisations and the Chautala clan led by former Chief Minister Om Parkash Chautala is holding marathon meetings all over the State. Political observers here recall that Mr. Hooda's second consecutive term began on an uncertain note as the Congress managed to win only 40 out of 90 seats in the October 2009 Assembly polls and it was able to form the government with the support of seven Independents who were made Ministers and Chief Parliamentary Secretaries. Interestingly, the INLD had won 31, Shiromani Akali Dal one, BJP four, BSP one and HJC (BL) six seats. Even as Mr. Bishnoi dilly-dallied in extending support to the Congress, the five HJC(BL) MLAs merged the legislature party with the Congress. Mr. Bishnoi approached the High Court in August this year as he felt that the Speaker was adopting delaying tactics'' in deciding his petition. According to sources close to Mr. Chautala, the perception in the INLD is that in the wake of disqualification of these five members by the Speaker, the Congress could face a political crisis even though it would not lose its majority in the Assembly because of the support of the Independents. The INLD think-tank is also minutely watching the internal bickering and groupism within the Congress which could further aggravate in the months to come''. A senior leader told The Hindu that the party would try to derive political advantage if such a scenario emerged and the equations'' changed so far as the Independents were concerned. However, senior Congress leaders ridicule such claims and say that whatever be the Speaker's verdict, it would not have any bearing on the stability of the Congress regime in the State. Mr. Hooda, political observers say, is playing a calculated game of one-upmanship. Despite pressure from his known detractors within the party, he has managed to postpone the Cabinet expansion and appointment of chairmen of boards and corporations. Moreover, the continuance of outgoing Haryana Congress unit chief Phool Chand Mullana as interim president has also come as a shot for Mr.Hooda. Even though the critics'' including a Central Minister and some MPs have been apprising the High Command of the working of the State Government and its failure to handle the Mirchpur situation which has agitated the Dalits, the agitation by the Jats seeking reservation and the non-consolidation of non-Jat votes, to mention a few, the party leadership has thought it best to not disturb the status quo in Haryana, said a senior Haryana watcher.

Talking to media persons at his official residence here, the former Chief Minister who is now Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly, alleged that the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government had failed miserably to protect the interests of the farming community and other sections of society. Accusing the Congress Government of pursuing policies which were highly capitalist-centric, he said corruption and scams had become the order of the day. Referring to the death of a 70-year-old farmer due to biting cold while protesting against the Government's decision to acquire fertile land in Fatehabad district for setting up a nuclear plant, Mr. Chautala asserted that the land acquisition policy of the Hooda regime was flawed and heavily loaded in favour of big capitalists. He said that agricultural land worth several crores of rupees had been acquired from farmers at throwaway prices and sold away to private players in the name of setting up of Special Economic Zones or other projects. Interestingly, the same land was later sold off by the private players for crores of rupees. Mr. Chautala further charged that no SEZ had come up in the State so far. He further charged that the Hooda regime had imposed taxes in one form or the other on the common man who was already reeling under the impact of severe inflation. Moreover, there was no law and order in the State, he added. Replying to a question, Mr. Chautala said no agricultural land should be acquired but if it was absolutely necessary to do so then compensation should be paid to the farmer at market rates and it should be utilised for the earmarked development and not handed over to the private players.

The speakers lashed out at the government for its callous attitude towards the lawyers' genuine demandthough their agitation was dragging on now for the past 100 days and threatened to intensify their stir to exert pressure on the government. Leaders of the Bar Association wondered why the government dragged its feet so long when States like Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra etc. were already having additional benches. They were also critical about the government trying to link up their agitation with the separate Telengana stir and said that their agitation was only for decentralisation of the judicial administration for the benefit of both the department and the public and to tackle the problem of mounting pendency of cases.

At the seminar on SC/ST Sub-Plan Law organised by the Dalit Bahujan Front State Committee here on Saturday, he said that this law was the result of the hard work and sacrifice of many people. There had been many laws made for the development and protection of Dalits but due to improper implementation the desired results were not achieved, he said. Banks, committees Separate banks must be opened for the funds of the SC/ST sub-plan to reach Dalits and Girijans and also no-assurance loans must be given to them, opined the Minister. These funds must be used for providing education, health and basic amenities to Dalits and Girijans, he added. Separate committees must be created to look into the proper implementation of this law and also the distribution of funds, he added. Dalits had been downtrodden for the past 30 years, said the DBFSC president Korivi Vinay Kumar. Due to the governments neglect the provision in successive budgets was unfair to Dalits and Girijans, he opined. The reservations in jobs must also be increased from 18 per cent to 20 per cent as the number of Dalit people had increased, he said. The DBFSC State secretary Shankar expressed his happiness over the government creating the law which grants Dalits the right to question. The funds need to be diverted and equally distributed for the benefit of Dalits, he said. Amount sanctioned -- Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 70,000 -- were not enough for building a house, so the government should increase them to Rs.2.5 lakh and Rs.3 lakh, he said. Scholarship amounts also must be increased to suit the rising costs, he added. The K.V.P.S district unit leader G. Nataraj, B.C. Welfare Association president Buddha Nageswara Rao, K.V.P.S. convener P. Rajesh and the DBFSC leaders P. Shankar, A. Dev Kumar, G. Manikyala Raju, Sujatha, P. Jyothi were present at the seminar.

        "content": " Expressing outrage over the death of Savita Halappanavar (31) in Ireland on October 28 following denial of necessary abortion services, sexual rights advocacy groups have termed it unacceptable and inexcusable and made a strong case for abortion as a fundamental right of women across the globe. The life of Dr. Halappanavar, a dentist from Karnataka who had settled with her husband Praveen Halappanavar in Ireland, was tragically cut short when doctors refused to abort the foetus she had miscarried saying the foetal heartbeat was present and that this is a Catholic country. Seventeen weeks pregnant, she died from septicaemia. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) and member association Family Planning Association of India (FPA India) have expressed their indignation over the incident, saying Dr. Halappanavar would have been alive today had there been clarity and equality to exercise the rights of women in Ireland. The IPPF believes that access to safe abortion is the fundamental right of every woman and that it is incumbent upon us to create an enabling environment to allow women to exercise this choice, said IPPF (South Asia Region) regional director Anjali Sen. It is unacceptable that Dr. Halappanavar was denied of a basic human right at the University Hospital Galway, a 650+ bedded tertiary care centre in Ireland. Right and necessary care could have saved her life. It is inexcusable that doctors, instead of undertaking efforts to save her, watched her die, she said. The IPPF said it found it difficult to believe that society and international governments required the loss of a life to wake up to this dichotomy of laws that unduly curbed and controlled womens rights to choose what was best for their body and family. While there is no single law specific to men that states when, where or how medical care should be provided; around the world, to this day, governments enact laws that prescribe, confuse and curtail a womans access to safe abortion services, said Ms. Sen. FPA India secretary general Viswanath Koliwad said this incident should be an eye-opener for many countries and societies that did not recognise a womans right to safe abortion services. Even in India, where abortion has been legal under stated circumstances, there is a crying need to ensure that access to safe abortion services is a reality for women and that there are no restrictions placed to access them up-to 20 weeks, Mr. Koliwad, an advocate and service provider of safe abortion services in India, said.

People of the village, who had gathered outside the polling booth, did not allow anybody to enter the booth. When presspersons asked them the reason for boycott, they alleged that their village was neglected by the elected representatives and the Government. They said there were no basic amenities in their village. They alleged that the barrage built across the Kali breached about 25 years ago and the backwaters entered their fields. Their farmland had been rendered useless because of this. Even after repeated requests nobody came to their help. They alleged that the road in the village was not repaired for decades. Besides, there was no electricity and hospital in the village. So they decided to boycott the election. If their demands were not fulfilled, they would not cast their vote in future too, they said. But Narayan Shankar Naik of the village alleged that a few persons prevented the voters from going to the booth. Majority of the voters in the village wanted to vote. But the hooligans were blocking them. Narayan proudly showed the ink mark on his finger. He said he and another person had exercised their franchise. He said people who did not want to confront the hooligans stayed away from voting. If we boycotted the election how would we go to the representatives and ask them to solve our problems?  OPEN",

During the year, President Pratibha Patil, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Vice-President Hamid Ansari logged nearly two dozen visits. Taken with Foreign Minister S.M. Krishna's visits to 18 countries, the outbound and inbound diplomatic traffic demonstrated a a qualitative expansion of strategic relations with key partner countries and a robust engagement with India's neighbours, said the Foreign Office in a year-ender statement. Growing global profile The government hosted 24 Heads of states/governments and 30 Foreign Minister-level visitors. In the same period, the President, the Vice-President and the Prime Minister visited 22 countries for multilateral or bilateral engagements. The second half of the year was busier and more substantive with India hosting Heads of state/government of all the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, covering visits of the Prime Minister of the U.K. (July), the President of the U.S. (November), the President of France (December), the Premier of China (December), and the President of Russia (December). This is widely seen as a visible acknowledgment of India's growing regional and global profile. At the Toronto and Seoul G-20 Summits, the Prime Minister deliberated with fellow leaders on steadying the global financial ship, which had barely emerged from turbulent waters,'' said the Foreign Office statement. From the neighbourhood, there were visits by the Presidents of Nepal, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, the King and Prime Minister of Bhutan, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and Head of state from Myanmar. But, instead of Dr. Singh, Mr. Krishna paid official visits to Kathmandu, Kabul, Colombo, Thimphu (Dr. Singh went for a SAARC summit), Kabul and Islamabad. Ms. Patil went to China in May and Premier Wen Jiabao came to India in December to mark the 60th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between India and China. Ms. Patil also visited Laos, Cambodia, United Arab Emirates and Syria. During the year, India's quest for ensuring its energy security was acknowledged, including India's pursuit of civil nuclear energy cooperation which has become an important area of strategic partnership with several countries, noted the Foreign Office.

The Prohibition of Child Marriage Rules 2012 has been added to the existing Prohibition of Child Marriages Act 2006 and officials had been appointed for this purpose. The officials, who will be responsible for abolishing child marriages, are the Collector at district level, Revenue Divisional Officer/ Sub-Collector at the divisional level, panchayat secretary at the village-level and the Village Administrative Officer (VAO). Their main responsibility will be to ensure that Registration of Marriage Act 2002 will be followed and inform the police and take necessary action in case of information about child marriages. They will also have to create awareness about the implications of a child marriage to the common man and organise social welfare programmes for the benefit of orphan kids. The officials were also granted special powers in case a child marriage takes place in their region according to the press release. They have been given the power to conduct proper investigation, issue notices to offenders, and question the victims and witnesses. At the same time strict action will be taken against the officials in case they fail to stop a child marriage. Village panel Apart from the government officials, a village committee consisting of panchayat secretary, VAO, self-help organisation members, school teachers, elected female members of the panchayat, heads of villages, and accredited social health workers will also be formed. Strict orders had been given to this committee to pay a close attention during celebrations such as Akshaya Tritiya, Maha Sivaratri, and Kalyanamasthu so that any child marriage can be avoided. They were also asked to take proper action against doctors and other officials who issue wrong birth and age certificates for the sake of weddings.  OPEN",

        "content": " When an accident is caused by a stolen vehicle and it is ascertained that the rider has no driving licence, can the insurance company disown liability? No, the Madras High Court has said. The question came up before Justice R.Mala while deciding an appeal filed by an insurance company against the award of Rs.4.94 lakh by a Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal here to an accident victims family. Dismissing the appeal, Ms.Justice Mala said the owner should establish that he was an innocent sufferer. It was for this reason that the legislature had made insurance, at least third party insurance, compulsory. In order to avoid liability it was not sufficient to show that the person driving the vehicle at the time of accident did not have a licence. The insurance company should establish that the breach was on the part of the insured. On July 2, 2001, Ramachandran was fatally knocked down by a motorcycle on MTH Road at Villivakkam here. R.Chinnammal and four others, legal heirs, moved the MACT, III Judge, Small Causes Court here, seeking compensation. Denying its liability, New India Assurance Company Ltd., filed a counter stating that the motorcycle involved had been stolen on June 21, 2001. The owner had preferred a complaint. On the date of accident, the vehicle was not in possession of its owner. Moreover, the vehicle number had also been changed. There was no relationship of employer and employee between the driver and owner of the vehicle. Hence, the insurance company was not liable to pay compensation. The tribunal awarded Rs.4.94 lakh as compensation to the victims legal heirs. Hence, the present appeal by the insurance company. T.Aarumugham and V.S.Suresh, counsel for the legal heirs, submitted that as per a Kerala High Court judgment in the Sasidharan Nair case, the insurance company was liable to pay compensation. Counsel sought dismissal of the appeal. Ms.Justice Mala said that at the time of accident, the insurance policy was in force. Another person had subsequently purchased the vehicle. Citing a Supreme Court decision, the Judge said she was of the view that the insurance company should establish that there was a breach on the part of the insured. On the accident date, the vehicle was not in the owners custody, but insured.  OPEN",

According to police, around 12.15 a.m., K. Kamesh (27), was on his way home to Sathyamurthy Nagar in Vysarpadi, when an armed gang led by S. Bokka Ravi Kumar (27) attacked him. Kamesh suffered serious head and chest injuries, and died on the spot. The gang then drove away on motorcycles. The body, when found, was sent by police to the Government Stanley Hospital for a post-mortem examination. A case of murder under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code was filed by Vyasarpadi police. Police officers later arrested Bokka Ravi Kumar the main accused, a resident of Nehru Nagar; H. Karthikeyan (25), a resident of MKB Nagar; K. Dhanushu (23), a resident of JJ Nagar; K. Yuvaraj (24), a resident of SM Nagar and K. Vigneshwaran alias Vicky (23), also resident of SM Nagar, while the sixth accused is still absconding. The murder was committed due to personal enmity.

But over the last few years, gang wars in different parts of north Chennai have escalated, with brutal killings committed in full public view. Vyasarpadi, MKB Nagar, Pulianthope and adjoining areas especially, have become hotbeds of gang rivalry and their subsequent fall-outs. North Chennai has always been notorious for history-sheeters, but from mid-2007 onwards, things had been relatively quiet. Ever since the encounter killing of gangster Vellai Ravi of Vyasarpadi, gang rivalries have been on a low simmer, with relatively few flare-ups. Swift police action following the encounter also kept gangsters at bay. But from mid-2010 onwards, the situation began to deteriorate again, with several small gangs surfacing. Early on Saturday, Kamesh of Sathyamoorthy Nagar, was hacked to death by a gang. Kamesh had been released from prison just last month, after being arrested for the killing of a rival. A rivalry had been brewing for some time between two big groups, that of Kamesh and Babulu and that of Bokkai Ravi Kumar and Ranjith as well as between several small gangs based in Vyasarpadi. In 2010, Kamesh and his men hacked to death Kalaiarasan, an aide of Ravis. According to a police officer attached to the Vyasarpadi station, gang wars occur primarily to determine supremacy in the locality. These gangs do not deal in drugs but are small- time robbers involved in lots of thefts recorded in other parts of the city. They all live in the locality and so, group clashed often occur with killings as the result, the officer added. Some gang members also extort money from local shopkeepers and traders, threatening them with dire consequences. The gangs generally fight only between themselves and do not attack residents. But the fear of what is going to happen next is always at the back of the mind of every resident, said a resident.  Over the past few years, gang fights have escalated, with brutal killings due to personal enmity  OPEN",

Karunanidhi on Saturday asked the Centre to consider his proposal to introduce solitary life imprisonment as maximum punishment for rape convicts, as the State government has refused to consider it. In a statement here, he said though leaders of various political parties had favoured death sentence for rapists, he alone favoured solitary confinement for life as appropriate punishment. I wanted the State government and the Centre to take firm steps to implement my suggestion. Like many social activists and thinkers, I am not in favour of capital punishment, he said. Referring to Chief Minister Jayalalithaas proposal to detain rape suspects under the Goondas Act, he argued that the detention under that law was only for a year. There is no guarantee that they will not commit similar crimes after release, he said. Mr. Karunanidhi also said the Goondas Act had been misused in the State against to settle scores with political opponents. Mr. Karunanidhi claimed that in Tamil Nadu, the only action that was taken against sexual offences was filing a case for namesake in a police station. When a 13-year-old girl was raped and murdered in Tuticorin district, the government woke up to the incident only after the DMK released financial assistance to the family and party MP Kanimozhi called on the girls mother, he said. Demanding adequate relief to the families of rape victims, Mr Karunanidhi alleged that instead of taking such measures the government had announced a 13-point programme. These steps will only generate statements welcoming the plan, but will not ensure help for the victims and their families, he said. The government should ensure that the 13-point action plan would not remain on paper and really prevent the crime and provide relief to the victims, he added.

        "content": " A seven-year-old girl was raped in the toilet of a school in Old Goa last month. Within a few days, a 13-year-old migrant boy was kidnapped and sodomised near the old railway station at Margao. Statistics with the Goa police reveal that 68 per cent of rape cases registered in 2012 involved minors. Of the 54 cases of rape registered across the State in 2012, 31 were registered under the Goa Childrens Act. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, Goa ranked fifth in the number of reported crimes against children in 2011. It is mostly child labour at construction sites, fishing jetties, shacks, beaches and other places who become easy victims of violence and sexual abuse. It is for such abandoned or runaway children living on streets, children from economically weak families and abused backgrounds that Prince Aoran Golden and his wife Sujatha provide a secure and homely environment where they are cared for and loved. Our children are vulnerable because we dont make them aware about the risks and dangers they can be exposed to, Prince says. It was in 2000 when Prince and Sujatha saw a child eating leftover food from a heap of garbage. The couple was appalled and wanted to talk to the child but he ran away. The couple followed him to Sangolda slum area where the child was living with his mother who worked as a part time domestic help. Prince and Sujatha wanted to take the boy under their care but his mother was reluctant to part with Arun and even doubted their intentions. But months later, she changed her mind and approached the couple. Aruns arrival at their home gave birth to the idea of forming a charitable trust Care and Compassion - Goa and taking in more children under its fold, says Prince. Today, there are 20 children  12 girls and eight boys  living in two separate homes run by the couple. The youngest child is in the kindergarten while the eldest one, Rani, will soon graduate in nursing. All the children go to good English-medium schools and colleges. Prince says he is determined to give them quality education so that they are able to get decent jobs. Soniya studying commerce in a junior college wants to become a banker. She recently topped the inter-college exams. Manjula wants to become a social worker. Prince and Sujatha do not have children of their own; their life revolves around these children. Who is good in which subject, who has an aptitude for music, which school or college should be chosen, should they opt for science or arts or study something else or about their dress or the menu for the meals  these are things that keep them on the go. It is mostly Sujatha who helps the children with their homework. It is not always studies, there is a lot of fun, too, whether it is a picnic at the beach or participating in painting competitions or swimming or workshops in arts and story writing. A family friend, Nigel, gives lessons in skate boarding to boys every Sunday. Today Arun is working in a shack at one of the beaches and has gone back to his mother. He has renovated the shanty they were living in. Another boy, Sudhir, is working as a technician at Dabolim airport. However, most of the children have nowhere to go like Rani. So once she finishes her B.Sc. in nursing, Prince says they will try to ensure that she gets a job in a good hospital abroad and get her married. We are living in a very unsafe world. Together we should work to protect and safeguard the interest of all children whether they are our own or not, says Prince.  OPEN",

He advised the personnel to keep in mind developments in the sea like the soil erosion. Commandant of the Indian Coastguard Station Kakinada S.N.M.

The Lokayukta's closure report in the dumper scam involving Chauhan, his wife Sadhana Singh and others has shattered people's faith in the reputed and impartial institution -- Lokayukta, Communist Party of India (Marxist) State Secretary Badal Saroj said in a press statement. He termed the Lokayukta's closure report in the alleged dumper scam as a move to cover up the truth as the evidences, affidavits in the scam had been overlooked. The Lokayukta (Ombudsman) had in its report submitted to the Court of Special Judge R. P. S Chauhan that no case against Chauhan, Sadhana and others could be made out following investigations into the three-year-old case, which related to purchase of four dumpers. The Lokayukta police had registered a case on November 15, 2007, against Chouhan, Sadhana and others under different sections of the Indian Peanl Code, including 420 (cheating), and Prevention of Corruption Act and launched a probe following an order by a Bhopal court.

        "content": " Aqeel Shatir, a budding Urdu poet of the city, has decided to take on the Gujarat Urdu Sahitya Academy, which has penalised him for including an allegedly defamatory paragraph on Chief Minister Narendra Modi in a foreword to his book of poems published with government aid. Claiming that the copies of the book on sale do not contain the objectionable paragraph, Mr. Shatir has questioned the Academy's wisdom in seeking refund. Will my mere returning the money restore Mr. Modi's image among the people? But the Academy has not stated why Mr. Shatir's explanation is not amenable to it; nor has it taken up his challenge to prove that the copies on sale did not carry the objectionable paragraph. Not me, but the Academy should be blamed for damaging the Chief Minister's image by putting back on the public domain a non-existent and long-forgotten issue, he says. How can the damage be repaired by my paying back the money as asked by the Academy? The paragraph critical of Mr. Modi for the 2002 communal riots was written by another poet Raunaq Afroz Bhiwandi, one of the famous Urdu writers who wrote the foreword to Mr. Shatir's first book of poems Abhi Zinda Hoon Main (I am Still Alive). The book was published in October 2008, with the Academy's assistance of Rs.10, 000, which is meant for budding writers who need help to bring out their works. Mr. Shatir maintains that his poems were not based on the riots. But Mr. Bhiwandi thought so and incorporated a paragraph against Mr. Modi in his five-page foreword. Unfortunately, the book with the contentious paragraph was printed before Mr. Shatir's attention was drawn to it by another Urdu writer and Academy member Mohiuddin Bombaywala, who was among the 80-odd recipients of the book gifted by Mr. Shatir during the launch. As soon as my attention was drawn to it, I removed the pages containing the paragraph from all the remaining copies before they were put up for sale in the market, claims Mr. Shatir. The copies gifted to the noted writers that carried the objectionable paragraph were only meant for private circulation. However, the Academy served a notice on him on November 15, more than two years after the book was published. It asked him to explain why he should not be directed to refund the money with interest for publicly damaging Mr. Modi's image. His December 1 reply, explaining the position and refuting the allegation that the copies on sale continued to carry the paragraph, was rejected by the Academy. A three-line order, issued by Academy Registrar Harshad Trivedi on December 24, told Mr. Shatir that his explanation has not been accepted, and you should immediately return the amount with interest to the Academy. I am going to fight it out, says Mr. Shatir, an amateur photo-journalist and an STD-PCO owner. Further, the order did not mention when he must pay back the money and the rate of interest as well as the period of interest. How can the government-run Academy ask me to pay back without specifying the necessary details? In the past, Mr. Shatir tapped the Right to Information Act to pose questions about the Academy's style of functioning and the alleged irregularities in the disbursement of funds in the name of rewards and awards to the deserving writers. And he has vowed to carry on his work. Whether or not I am forced to refund the money, I am going to bombard the Academy with more searching questions under the RTI and expose its wrongdoings.

        "content": " In a surprise development, the Gujarat government legal department on Friday issued a revised order withholding the transfers of 11 judicial officers, including the two presiding officers of the special courts hearing the 2002 communal riot cases. The revised order, the government sources said, was issued at the behest of the Gujarat High Court. At the recommendation of the High Court, the transfer orders were issued to 11 judicial officers on Thursday, including Mr M. H. Shah, who was functioning as the Secretary of the legal department of the State government. The reason for withholding the transfers, at least for the time being, was not immediately known. The sources said the revised order said all the transfers should be kept pending till January 14 and all the transferred judges would continue to function at the same place till further orders. The transfer orders had baffled the legal experts because it included the judges hearing the two most heinous massacres of 2002, Gulberg Society, where 69 people were burnt alive, and Naroda-Patia, which accounted for 96 deaths. The hearing in both the cases had reached almost the concluding stages and the legal experts feel that a change of the presiding officer at this stage could delay the final proceedings. The transfer of the controversial session judge, B. U. Joshi, who was hearing the Gulberg Society massacre case, had come as a great relief to many victims and the Mumbai-based voluntary organisation, the Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), which had been demanding a change of the judge accusing him of biased towards the accused. The High Court, which was earlier petitioned for a change after the principal sessions judge expressed his inability to make changes, had earlier rejected the demand of the CJP and the issue was pending in the Supreme Court. Mr. Joshi, who was transferred to Dahod, was earlier asked to hand over the charge of the Gulberg Society court by January 7 to his successor who was yet to be named. The judge of the special court hearing the Naroda-Patia massacre case, Jyotsnaben Yagnik, was transferred to Himmatnagar, the district headquarter of Sabarkantha, but for the time being would continue to function at the existing courts.

        "content": " The population of Abalones, the marine gastropod mollusc, Haliotis varia, has drastically dwindled along Gulf of Mannar due to anthropogenic impact. Adequate measures should be taken to protect the endangered species from further depletion to conserve the biodiversity. In Gulf of Mannar (GoM), one small sized abalone species (Haliotis varia) was rarely available in two small beds of Tuticorin coast and Krusadai Island of Mandapam, J.K. Patterson Edward, Director, Suganthi Devadasan Marine Research Institute (SDMRI), Tuticorin said on Friday. Due to rare population, there was no commercial trade of this species. Based on survey by SDMRI, which is affiliated to Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli, during its coral reef diversity inventory, the findings indicated that abalone population along GoM was threatened. The entire population along Tuticorin coast, which was once rich with over 300 adults and juveniles during 2003 - 2004, is completely vanished now. Hence this lone species is rarely available only on Krusadai Island. The abalone meat has high demand for its delicacy in countries abroad. Unlike other countries, the commercially viable field level culture technology is not available for abalone production in India. The only option to conserve the remaining few abalone populations along GoM, is to avoid factors causing disturbances to abalone beds in Krusadai Island for a minimum of fifteen years. Protection and management efforts are also necessary required to restore the abalone bed. It is high time to adopt conservatory measures to protect the lone threatened abalone, H.varia from depletion, Dr. Patterson added. Successful commercial culture practices were adopted in the middle of 1990s in countries abroad. The commercial abalone farming countries for consumption include China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, Namibia, New Zealand, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States. S. Narayanan, Regional Deputy Director, National Wild Life Crime Control Bureau, told TheHindu that If the authorities concerned of State government find it an endangered species, it could be recommended to Central government for including it under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 for legal protection. J.D. Jameson, former Director, Research and Extension, FCRI, Tuticorin, said twenty four other molluscan species were being legally protected. M. Sundarakumar, Wild Life Warden, Ramanathapuram, said the officials were strictly monitoring the Krusadai Island since it was under the radius of Marine National Park.  OPEN",

Kolkata was considered the pride of India. It was always upheld as a city where any woman could walk without any degree of insecurity during the day or night. That reputation has taken a beating, he said. The hallmark of the Trinamool Congress government had been a regression in the democratic structures and institutions. The law and order situation had deteriorated, particularly in regard to womens security, Mr. Yechury said. Asked about attacks on workers of Left parties, he said it is an ominous sign and a negative signal for democracy. Incidents like forcing candidates to withdraw their nomination papers [for the coming rural polls] were nothing else but an outcome of the politics of terror under the umbrella of democracy, he noted. On the ongoing fight between the State Election Commission and the State government on security for the rural polls, he said the election panels suggestion to have Central forces and hold polls in different phases are only aimed at conducting free and fair elections.

RPSF officials here told The Hindu that Sukanta was one among the five men deployed for train escort duty in Bihar. On the fateful day on June 13, he was on DhanbadPatna Intercity Express, when the heavily armed Maoists pulled the alarm chain at Bhalui halt near Jamui district and opened fire on the train. The officials said Sukanta, who was armed with an INSAS rifle retaliated, but was killed in the firing by the Maoists. Two of his colleagues from the same Battalion M. Saravanan and G.J. Chandru also retaliated. They survived the dastardly attack. The RPSF 5{+t}{+h}Battalion and the All India RPF Association has expressed grief and said Constable Sukanta had laid down his life while fighting the Maoists.

On Tuesday, families residing in the village converged at Raktha Sketharam, the place where the bodies of Dalits were buried, and offered their homage to the departed souls. A meeting was held in which Dalit Bahujan Front convener Korivi Vinaya Kumar and others spoke. But years after the incident, Dalit associations say justice is still eluding them. An appeal seeking life imprisonment to 35 persons who were convicted and awarded simple imprisonment by Special Court Judge Anis in the year 2007 is still pending in the High Court. The special court awarded life imprisonment to 21 persons. The State government had not appointed a successor to special public prosecutor B. Chandrasekhar, who died in January this year. Jaladi Wilson, convener of Tsunduru Dalit Victims Association, told The Hindu they had requested the government to appoint Bojja Tarakam as Special Public Prosecutor to present the case. Back on August 6, 1991, the savage attack on Dalits left eight persons dead but had many more wounded. In a planned attack, the Dalits fleeing for safety were lynched, their bodies pierced into pieces, stuffed into gunny bags and thrown in the Tungabhadra drain. One more youth, Anil Kumar, was killed in police firing in the village. The gory incident galvanised the Dalits into launching a nationwide crusade seeking social justice and emancipation of Dalits. Dalits in towns and villages poured on the streets protesting the massacre. The State government doled out welfare schemes in a bid to contain the anger but was forced to act firmly against the perpetrators of the most heinous attack on Dalits in Indias modern history. Police filed charge-sheets against 219 people belonging to Tsunduru and neighbouring villages. Under pressure from Dalit associations, the State government established a special court under the provisions of SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in Tsunduru to try the accused. On a tense day on August 1, 2007, special court judge Anis convicted 56 accused, out of which 21 were awarded life imprisonment and 35 simple imprisonments. It let off 115 others citing lack of evidence.   OPEN",

According to Tahsildar-Election B.S. Hiriyanna, an estimated 68 per cent of the electorate exercised their votes in the district. While Alur recorded the highest of 72 per cent, Arsikere recorded the lowest of 60 per cent voting. The voting percentage in the rest of the taluks is: Holenarsipur 65, Hassan 68, Arkalgud 70, Belur 61, Channarayapatna 68 and Sakleshpur 70. Polling, which commenced on a dull note in the morning, later gained momentum. While the turnout was low a in few polling stations, voters lined up in a majority of the polling stations and enthusiastically exercised their franchise. Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and former Minister H.D. Revanna exercised their franchise at a polling station in Paduvalahippe in Holenarsipur taluk. The slow pace of voting in Arkalgud taluk created anxiety among the contestants. However, they heaved a sigh of relief once the voters started rushing towards the polling stations. A voting machine fell down and got damaged during a clash between Janata Dal(S) and Congress workers in the Dudda Zilla Panchayat constituency. However, polling continued after authorities changed the voting machine. The police had made tight security arrangements at Bhuvanahalli in view of the tense situation because of the death of zilla panchayat member B.R. Nilappa. However, polling continued peacefully. Polling was peaceful in Sakleshpur taluk except for a few incidents of minor clashes. Many polling stations recorded 60 per cent voting by 2 p.m. When Ningamma (75) came to exercise her franchise at Valalahalli polling station, she was refused permission, as she had been declared dead in the electoral rolls. The police interfered, when a wordy duel ensued between zilla panchayat candidate of the Janata Dal(S) and workers of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party resulted in minor clash. The BJP workers protested against Mr. Revanna accusing him of interfering in the polling process in Paduvalahippe village. In an interesting incident, a man stole a voting machine in the early hours of Friday and threw it in a well in Chikkonahalli village of Channarayapatna taluk. Based on a report by Tahsildar, Channarayapatna, Varaprasada Reddy, Deputy Commissioner Naveen Raj Singh suspended six people, including one constable, in connection with the incident. People in Bidarakka village in Holenarsipur taluk and Konanuru town of Arkalgud taluk boycotted the election. People in Bidarakka refused to vote in the election protesting against the apathy of the district administration in declaring the village, with voter strength of 1,300 in the backwaters of the Hemavathi as cold-affected village. When one group of people tried to exercise their franchise, there was a clash between the two groups in Bidarakka.

        "content": " Aqeel Shatir, a budding Urdu poet of the city, has decided to take on the Gujarat Urdu Sahitya Academy, which has penalised him for including an allegedly defamatory paragraph on Chief Minister Narendra Modi in a foreword to his book of poems published with government aid. Claiming that the copies of the book on sale do not contain the objectionable paragraph, Mr. Shatir has questioned the Academy's wisdom in seeking refund. Will my mere returning the money restore Mr. Modi's image among the people? But the Academy has not stated why Mr. Shatir's explanation is not amenable to it; nor has it taken up his challenge to prove that the copies on sale did not carry the objectionable paragraph. Not me, but the Academy should be blamed for damaging the Chief Minister's image by putting back on the public domain a non-existent and long-forgotten issue, he says. How can the damage be repaired by my paying back the money as asked by the Academy? The paragraph critical of Mr. Modi for the 2002 communal riots was written by another poet Raunaq Afroz Bhiwandi, one of the famous Urdu writers who wrote the foreword to Mr. Shatir's first book of poems Abhi Zinda Hoon Main (I am Still Alive). The book was published in October 2008, with the Academy's assistance of Rs.10, 000, which is meant for budding writers who need help to bring out their works. Mr. Shatir maintains that his poems were not based on the riots. But Mr. Bhiwandi thought so and incorporated a paragraph against Mr. Modi in his five-page foreword. Unfortunately, the book with the contentious paragraph was printed before Mr. Shatir's attention was drawn to it by another Urdu writer and Academy member Mohiuddin Bombaywala, who was among the 80-odd recipients of the book gifted by Mr. Shatir during the launch. As soon as my attention was drawn to it, I removed the pages containing the paragraph from all the remaining copies before they were put up for sale in the market, claims Mr. Shatir. The copies gifted to the noted writers that carried the objectionable paragraph were only meant for private circulation. However, the Academy served a notice on him on November 15, more than two years after the book was published. It asked him to explain why he should not be directed to refund the money with interest for publicly damaging Mr. Modi's image. His December 1 reply, explaining the position and refuting the allegation that the copies on sale continued to carry the paragraph, was rejected by the Academy. A three-line order, issued by Academy Registrar Harshad Trivedi on December 24, told Mr. Shatir that his explanation has not been accepted, and you should immediately return the amount with interest to the Academy. I am going to fight it out, says Mr. Shatir, an amateur photo-journalist and an STD-PCO owner. Further, the order did not mention when he must pay back the money and the rate of interest as well as the period of interest. How can the government-run Academy ask me to pay back without specifying the necessary details? In the past, Mr. Shatir tapped the Right to Information Act to pose questions about the Academy's style of functioning and the alleged irregularities in the disbursement of funds in the name of rewards and awards to the deserving writers. And he has vowed to carry on his work. Whether or not I am forced to refund the money, I am going to bombard the Academy with more searching questions under the RTI and expose its wrongdoings.

        "content": " As doctor and human rights activist Binayak Sen spends New Year's Day in prison as the only person to be convicted on sedition charges in 2010, it is worth noting that at least five others have also faced the charge over the course of the year. Most of these have been charged for their statements with regard to either the Naxal issue or the Kashmir conflict, according to media watchdog site, TheHoot.org. Sedition is a crime dealt with in Section 124 A of the Indian Penal Code, which says that whoever by written or spoken words, or by signs or visible representations attempts or brings into hatred or contempt or attempts or excites disaffection towards the government established by law shall be punishable with life imprisonment. This was one of the charges that Dr. Sen was found guilty of last week. Perhaps the best known sedition cases of 2010 are those of celebrity activist and writer Arundhati Roy and Hurriyat leader S.A.P. Geelani, both of whom were charged for speeches they made at an October seminar on Kashmir titled Azaadi -- the only way. While the government initially decided not to initiate any criminal proceedings against the speeches, a Delhi city court directed the police to respond to the demand for a criminal case made by a group of Kashmiri Pandits. The High Court issued a similar notice in response to a PIL. Despite the police reporting that the accused had made no inflammatory speeches, the Metropolitan Magistrate directed the police to file an FIR and submit a report to the court by January 6, 2011. Rati Rao case The most bizarre case may have been that of E. Rati Rao, vice president of the Karnataka chapter of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, who was issued a sedition notice by the Vijayanagara police for bringing out an in-house bulletin in Kannada called PUCL Karnataka Varthapatra. Not only was the bulletin meant for private circulation only, its publication had actually been discontinued in September 2007, three years before the sedition notice was issued. Is the law on sedition being invoked a little too often for a democracy that values free speech? asks TheHoot.org's Free Speech Hub which tracked these sedition cases. In other cases, an environmental activist was charged with sedition for disrupting a government Republic Day function in Salem, Tamil Nadu by distributing Tamil pamphlets questioning the displacement of lakhs of tribals due to Operation Green Hunt and the non-implementation of a Supreme Court order for the rehabilitation of Chhattisgarh villagers. On the other end of the country, a lecturer of a Srinagar government college was arrested for allegedly setting an examination paper filled with questions related to the recent unrest in the Kashmir Valley. The police termed the question paper anti-Indian and seditious.  OPEN",

        "content": " In a surprise development, the Gujarat government legal department on Friday issued a revised order withholding the transfers of 11 judicial officers, including the two presiding officers of the special courts hearing the 2002 communal riot cases. The revised order, the government sources said, was issued at the behest of the Gujarat High Court. At the recommendation of the High Court, the transfer orders were issued to 11 judicial officers on Thursday, including Mr M. H. Shah, who was functioning as the Secretary of the legal department of the State government. The reason for withholding the transfers, at least for the time being, was not immediately known. The sources said the revised order said all the transfers should be kept pending till January 14 and all the transferred judges would continue to function at the same place till further orders. The transfer orders had baffled the legal experts because it included the judges hearing the two most heinous massacres of 2002, Gulberg Society, where 69 people were burnt alive, and Naroda-Patia, which accounted for 96 deaths. The hearing in both the cases had reached almost the concluding stages and the legal experts feel that a change of the presiding officer at this stage could delay the final proceedings. The transfer of the controversial session judge, B. U. Joshi, who was hearing the Gulberg Society massacre case, had come as a great relief to many victims and the Mumbai-based voluntary organisation, the Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), which had been demanding a change of the judge accusing him of biased towards the accused. The High Court, which was earlier petitioned for a change after the principal sessions judge expressed his inability to make changes, had earlier rejected the demand of the CJP and the issue was pending in the Supreme Court.

People may grumble about their shortage but the truth is that their numbers have been steadily increasing though theres no specific data for the city. However, conservative estimates put their number around four lakh in the State. Though the Karnataka Gruha Karmikara Sangha (KGKS) says the number of domestic workers in the city has been rising, it also means a concomitant increase in their exploitation by their employers. This is evident in the spike in number of complaints about exploitation of workers rights, observed Meena P., KGKS organiser. Horror stories Horror stories emerge when domestic help are the first suspects in any theft in the employers house. Shilpa (35) and Pavithra (40) (names changed), two domestic workers, were in the custody of the Cox Town police for four days, beaten black and blue with the lathis and questioned for hours on end. Their employer had lodged a complaint that the two had stolen some gold jewellery from his house. The police searched the womens homes but came up with nothing. The traumatised women turned to the Karnataka Gruha Karmikara Sangha (KGKS) for help. They were first taken to Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital for a medical check-up and a medical certificate on the nature of their injuries. The police, who got wind of this, contacted the employer and asked him to search his house again. It turned out that the mans son, who had recently gone abroad, had taken the gold with him. The employer, after withdrawing the case against the two women, asked them to resume work. The women refused. Massage request In another case, Rahela (name changed), a 16-year-old, was employed as a live-in help in a home in Benson Town for a meagre Rs. 300 a month. She put up with it for three years, working exhausting hours, even being told to massage her employers hands and legs. Rahela was not allowed to meet her mother, Shabnam, a resident of D.J. Halli, who used to go to collect her wages once a month. Finally, Shabnam approached the local leaders in D.J. Halli, who rescued Rahela without the employers knowledge. When the man filed a police complaint, the local leaders approached the KGKS. A counter complaint was lodged against the employer who offered Rs. 3,000 and asked for the case to be dropped. The case was dropped after the employer paid Rs. 15,000 to Rahela.   OPEN",

The Special Cell of Delhi Police filed the charge sheet in a court here against Immigration officer Chaman Azhar, an airline staffer Manoj Sarpal and Police Sub-Inspector Naveen Chandra alias Rajiv, accusing them of cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence under the Indian Penal Code and also offences under the Passports Act. The racket was busted after a woman, Navdeep Kaur, also an accused in the case, travelling on a Jet Airways flight to Toronto was deported from Brussels after she was found travelling on a fake passport. Her passport was issued in the name of Asha Panigrahi. She allegedly told the police that the passport was arranged by one Manveer, who had met her at Gurdwara Bangla Sahib here and could arrange a passport for her for Rs.6 lakh. The charge sheet filed before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vidya Prakash alleged that on March 28, 2011, Manveer dropped Kaur at IGI Airport where Manoj gave her a passport in the name of Asha Panigrahi, having a Jet Airways security sticker and also a boarding pass. He took the passport to Azhar who endorsed the immigration stamp on it and the boarding pass and provided another boarding pass of Air India to Kaur. After his arrest, Manoj allegedly disclosed that he, in connivance with Azhar, had sent Kaur abroad and till date facilitated the travel of eight such passengers. Upon interrogation, Azhar allegedly disclosed that he cleared passengers at the behest of one Naveen Upadhyaya, who lured him with money and also asked him to involve an airline official.

Head constable Ram Kishan had stopped a white Honda City for a routine vehicle check at Jonty Kannoda toll tax on the outskirts of the Capital around 2 a.m. when two of the car occupants opened fired at him following a scuffle. There were four people in the car and all of them were carrying weapons. When Ram Kishan stopped them for a routine check, they objected to the same and an altercation ensued. Ram Kishan asked them to come out of the car, but they refused and a scuffle broke out. The man in the passenger seat fired at Ram Kishan, hitting him in the thigh. Undeterred, Ram Kishan pulled him out of the car. At this, another man sitting on the rear seat fired two shots at Ram Kishan. He was hit in the shoulder and collapsed, said Ram Kishans brother Bharat Singh, recalling the incident as told to him by the police. Sub-Inspector Khazan Singh, head constable Bijender and constable G.K. Siddaia were standing at some distance from Ram Kishan when the incident took place. On hearing the gunshots, they ran towards Ram Kishan, who was lying in a pool of blood. The culprits took a u-turn and drove towards Haryana. Ram Kishan was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. We got a call from the police around 3.30 a.m. informing us about the tragedy. Later, some policemen came to us and took us to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, where Ram Kishans body was kept for post-mortem, said Mr. Bharat Singh. The last rites were performed with ceremonial honours at a cremation ground behind Surajmal Stadium in Nangloi around noon in the presence of senior police officers. Ram Kishan, a resident of Nangloi, had joined the Delhi Police in 1982. He was conferred the Asadharan Karya Puraskar in 2003. Ram Kishan is survived by his wife Sunil Devi and two sons. His older son Neeraj (21) is pursuing M. Tech from IIT-Roorkee, while younger son Dheeraj is doing B. Tech in Bahadurgarh. Recalling Ram Kishan as an upright and kind-hearted man, Mr. Bharat Singh said: He was wrestler and had won several awards. He had been the champion wrestler at a national-level police championship.

A magistrate court had referred Venkateshappa to the SMHC after the police arrested him near Kilimanoor on December 2 on the charge of behaving violently in public. Investigators said that Venkateshappa and Suresh Babu, a native of Thirupuram near Poovar, were confined in the same cell. Hospital janitors found Venkateshappa dead on December 4 afternoon. The SMHC authorities reported the matter to the local police and transferred the body to the Medical College Hospital mortuary. The police initially reported the incident as a case of suspicious death. A subsequent forensic examination confirmed murder. Injuries on neck and head had caused his death. Satnams case The police said Venkateshappas death could not be compared to the custodial death of a law student from Bihar, Satnam Singh, at the same institution early this year. The Crime Branch, which probed Satnam Singhs murder, had arraigned six persons, including hospital staff, as accused in the case. It had blamed the illegal practice of using cured patients, mostly convicts or under-trials, to subdue violent inmates as the reason for Satnams death. In comparison, the police said, so far, no SMHC staff had been found to have any role in Venkateshappas murder. The prime suspect in the case, Suresh Kumar, had been reported missing from his house at Poovar for over a month. A magistrate court had sent him to the SMHC after the Museum police detained him on the charge of showing aggression in public. His wife told the police that Suresh, a manual labourer, had been under psychiatric care for long. He was often sleepless but rarely violent, according to her. The police said they had sought the courts permission to take buccal swabs, from the cheek of the suspect, to extract his DNA for comparison with the debris, (skin, hair, blood, etc.), collected from the body of the victim, particularly his fingernails. Forensic pathologists, who conducted the post-mortem examination on Venkateshappas body, told the police that multiple actions of aggression and defence had preceded his death. They have ruled out the use of any weapon or blunt instrument in the murder. The police would question the doctors and staff at the SMHC as part of their investigation on Monday. Circle Inspector, Peroorkada, R. Pratapan, headed the investigation. The State police have contacted their counterparts in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to locate Venkateshappas address. So far, no one has claimed his body.

The bomb was detected hours before then Prime Minister V.P. Singh was about to address the meeting. After absconding for two decades, R. Chidambaram alias Sivakumar of Karur, a suspect in the case, was arrested in 2010 in connection with the incident. According to the Q branch police, an organisation called Tamil Pasarai was formed by a group of persons in Tiruchi with the object of achieving a separate Tamil Nadu. They plotted to plant bombs in buildings of the Central and State governments. Members of the organisation had brought the bomb into the Secretariat premises (Fort St. George) on September 20, 1990. On September 22, around 6.45 a.m., a police constable noted a white colour plastic jerry can containing explosives near the western side wall. The bomb was defused just hours before Mr. Singh and the then Chief Minister and other dignitaries were to take part in the NIC meeting at Namakkal Kavignar Maligai on the premises. Fourteen persons were cited as accused in the case. Three have already been convicted, while 10 others are still absconding. Designated Court No.I and I Additional Sessions Judge, K. Dakshinamoorthy said the charges against Chidambaram were proved beyond doubt. The accused was sentenced to life under two provisions of the TADA Act and 10 years rigorous imprisonment under the Explosive Substances Act. All sentences are to run concurrently. The Judge said the organisation to which the accused belonged had the secession of Tamil Nadu from the Union of India as its objective. If such activities are allowed, it will be a serious threat to Indian sovereignty.  OPEN",

Neutrophils, which form the first line of defence, are the most abundant class of white blood cells that help the body to fight infection.

According to the Alliance for People's Rights (APR), it filed RTI applications for all 12 police districts but received responses from only seven. Of the 2,161 children missing, police said they were able to recover 1,556 children. However, the APR said they have received complaints from parents of several missing children that the police were not registering FIRs based on their complaints and hence the figures furnished by the police in response to the RTI applications only convey a partial picture of the problem. APR convenor Bharat Singh was critical of police officers of the West District and South-East District for not responding to the RTI applications. The highest figure of missing children is from the Outer District where 549 children went missing. Aman Vihar police station recorded the most number of missing children in Outer district where 99 children went missing and 35 yet to be found. In North-West district, 465 children went missing. In Jehangirpuri police station limits, 217 children went missing of whom, 172 are yet to be found. The APR also presented before the media several parents whose children have been missing. Many of the parents had a similar story to tell of police apathy. The parents without exception said the policemen would not register their complaints in the first instance of them reporting the incident and it took them several visits to the police station to force the cops to register the complaint. Most of the parents of missing children alleged that the policemen even demanded bribes for registering complaints. The APR activists said the high number of cases of missing children was indicative of the fact that gangs kidnapping children were active in many areas and that the Delhi Police were not doing enough to bust these gangs. Reena Banerjee of the APR said the Integrated Child Development Services was not addressing the problems of migrant workers, most of whom had to leave their children uncared for while the parents went to work. She said crche facilities and anganwadis should be set up in every corner of Delhi if the problem of children being kidnapped is to be solved. Surender Singh, a social worker at Sangam Vihar, said children living in unauthorised colonies which have a large percentage of migrant labourers and poor households are easy prey for kidnappers as ICDS services are not provided in these areas.

Led by its convenor Javed Abidi, the DRJ members protested outside the Minister's house for two hours. On a day when rest of the nation is celebrating New Year parties, differently-abled persons from Delhi and the National Capital Region braved cold weather to observe a symbolic vigil outside Mr. Wasnik's residence. Had the Minister and the committee he has appointed listened to the voice of the physically-challenged persons such an agonising situation would not have arisen. What has disturbed and shocked us is that the Minister did not meet us. In a democracy, whether one agrees or not with someone's view yet you have to meet him, said Mr. Abidi. Noting that the Minister took seven months to accede to the disability sector's demand, the DRG convenor said the 27-member committee comprised parents, professionals and bureaucrats. Representation of differently-abled people was nominal. The committee was given four months to submit a draft law by August 31, 2010. It missed the deadline and asked for an extension till the end of October. After missing this deadline, it asked for an extension till December. The committee has still not been able to complete the task assigned to it. Now it has asked for more extension until March 31, 2011, said Mr. Abidi.  OPEN",

It contained 1.19 kg of heroin, 200 grams of methaqualone concealed in three parcels among a ladies handbag, cardboards used for packing of car gaskets and embroidery items addressed to destinations in West Africa, Australia and Spain. The value of the seized narcotic drug is more than Rs.1 crore in the international market.

The contraband had been procured from Namakkal and was part of the consignment of drugs already seized and was meant for despatch to foreign countries through courier. James is being questioned. He added that in recent times, most cases of seizure of drugs through courier parcels had been made by NCB in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, especially in Chennai and Ernakulam, and the parcels were booked by African nationals residing in Erode and Coimbatore. Individual case studies also revealed that some African nationals residing in and around Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode on student visas indulged in smuggling narcotic drugs abroad through couriered parcels.

We are here to change the politics of the country, declared Arvind Kejriwal, convener of the newly formed Aam Aadmi Party at a public meeting here on Monday. He formally announced the name of the party at Jantar Mantar, from where he and several other activists along with Anna Hazare had launched the anti-corruption movement last April. On Monday, attempts were made to give the centre stage to the common citizen through the slogan: Humara neta kaisa ho, aam aadmi jaisa ho. Naming several ministers and political leaders, he said the list of politicians against whom there were charges of corruption was long but if the Aam Aadmi Party came to power, they would be investigated and prosecuted within six months. The [anti-corruption] Jan Lokpal Bill, he asserted, can be passed within 15 days. The CBI can be made independent and fast track courts set up to try the corrupt and punish them. Sharing the dais with him were members of the newly elected national executive, senior lawyer Shanti Bhushan and former Navy Chief Admiral Ramdass who helped frame the partys constitution based on the principle of decentralised democracy. Mr. Bhushan donated Rs. 1 crore to the party. Lamenting that after 65 years of freedom, the common citizen was still struggling for basic requirements like electricity, water, food, education and healthcare, Mr. Kejriwal said, This is so because we are first-class citizens who are victims of third-class governance. With the entry of their party, the 2014 elections will witness a unique battle between netas (politicians) and aam aadmi (common man), he predicted. Corruption, he said, was fuelling inflation as corporate interests were being taken care of by the government at the expense of the common citizens. Vowing to make public the donations received by their party, as well as its expenses, he dared the Congress and the BJP to reveal how much they were spending on advertisements for the Gujarat polls.  He asked his supporters to pledge that they would not take or give bribes, not sell their vote for liquor, money or sarees, not vote on consideration of caste or religion and exercise their franchise in every election.

According to the Annur police, burglars, who scaled the temple wall, took away the idols and also two mangalsutra after breaking open the sanctum sanctorum door. The incident came to light when priest Thulasidas went to the temple on Sunday morning for the Margazhi pooja. He informed the trustees, who alerted the police. Burglars caught Two of the four burglars who made an attempt at a farmers house in Muthukavundan Layout, near Pollachi, were caught when they shouted in pain after the farmers hen pecked hard at them. The Pollachi police said that when Abu Thahir and Manikandan and the two others lifted the hen after they failed to enter Natarajs house, the hen pecked them. They shouted in pain and this alerted Nataraj and his neighbours who managed to nab the two. The two other accused managed to escape on a two-wheeler. Nataraj informed the police, who arrested the two accused. Two killed in accidents Newly wed Kannan (29) was killed in an accident near Kanjikonampalayam on Saturday. The Chettipalayam police said, Kannan was riding his motorcycle when an unidentified vehicle hit it. He was rushed to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, where he succumbed to injuries. In another accident in Vadavalli, Jaganathan (56) was killed on Thondamuthur Road when a car hit his two-wheeler. Preventive custody The Coimbatore City Police and their counterparts in rural areas took into preventive custody around 40 Pattali Makkal Katchi cadre on Sunday after the party announced that its members would stage a protest in front of TASMAC outlets and lock them on Monday.

There was mixed response to the strike call, which caused further hardship to the common man. The protest, called by 11 central trade unions hit banking operations, the insurance sector, oil and petroleum industries, Central/State government undertakings, transport (including buses, taxis and autos), functioning of industries and working of government offices in some States. ATMs went dry in many cities and rural areas. However, some private banks functioned. As many as 8 lakh cheques could not be cleared with Reserve Bank of India staff joining the strike. In Delhi, people continued to suffer as majority of autorickshaws and taxis stayed off the road. Long queues were seen at metro stations. DTC services were near-normal though a section of the employees extended support to the strike. Air and train services remained normal but commuters had difficulty in reaching or coming from airports/railway stations due to non-availability of public transport. Shops and markets remained open in many places. Schools, colleges were closed and examinations postponed in some States. The strike was called demanding urgent steps to control price rise, strict enforcement of labour laws in all places of work, social security for workers in the unorganised sector, end to disinvestment in PSUs and raising the minimum wages to Rs. 10,000 a month.

        "content": " Two powerful explosions ripped through crowded areas at Dilsukhnagar in the eastern part of the State capital on Thursday evening, killing 13 persons and injuring more than 83. The first blast took place at 6.50 p.m. on the citys busiest road that link it with Vijayawada, and, as terrified people were scampering to safety, the second blast went off. Authorities say the explosions were caused by improvised explosive devices that could have been kept on bicycles or packed inside frames of bicycles. The twin blasts brought back painful memories of the August 25, 2007 IED attacks in Lumbini Park, in front of the State secretariat, and at Gokul Chat in Kothi that killed 44 people. Incidentally, one of Thursdays blasts took place near a crowded foot over-bridge at Dilsukhnagar, where security forces defused an IED five years ago. The device was to go off along with the blasts in Lumbini Park and Gokul Chat. Eyewitnesses at Anand Tiffin Centre, near the spot where the first blast took place, said someone began shouting about a bomb going off. Even as confused people watched, the blast occurred. Malakpet Assistant Commissioner of Police Mohamed Iqbal, who was passing by in his police vehicle, stopped on hearing the explosion. As he ran towards the blast site, the second IED went off just 50 yards away. The blast sites presented a gory picture with injured persons and mangled two wheelers lying scattered. We did not know what was happening. It was scary, said a shopkeeper The area witnessed a massive traffic jam after the blasts. It took some time for the police to rush to the spot and organise relief and rescue operations. Local people stopped city buses and any vehicle they could find and shifted the injured to the Osmania General Hospital and the Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital at Malakpet. At the Osmania Hospital there were more than 30 injured people, while at the Yashoda Hospital one woman and 14 men were being treated. Nine persons were stated to be in a critical condition.  OPEN",

The throats of both the victims, Yasmeen and Sofia, were slit. Yasmeen lived with her husband Aslam Ali and their daughter Sofia on the first floor of the house in C Block of Rohini Sector 1 while their four other children, all sons, are away studying at a boarding school in Kozhikode, Kerala. Aslam, who is a sanitary fitting contractor, had left home in the morning for a project site near his house. He told the police that a few hours later when he was on his way home for lunch he met an acquaintance near his house. Even as he was engaged in a conversation with the acquaintance, a neighbour told him that smoke was coming out of his house. Suspecting something amiss, Aslam rushed in and found an injured Yasmeen lying in a pool of blood on the floor and Sofia in a similar condition on a bed. Aslam made a call to the Police Control Room around 2-15 p.m. The police rushed both to a nearby hospital where they were declared brought dead. Aslam purportedly told the police that the assailants had also tried to burn Yasmeen and in his attempt to save her he sustained burn injuries. A senior police officer said they were verifying the sequence of events narrated by Aslam. Neighbours of the victims said they were inside their homes and did not see anyone entering or leaving the house. No forced entry The police ruled out forced entry and said they are investigating the case from all angles. Aslams brother Ashraf said some gold jewellery was missing from the house. Aslam has seven brothers, all of whom live in close vicinity. No arrests have been made so far.  OPEN",

        "content": " Society made him a criminal and a murderer, says the former Supreme Court judge, Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer, about the cold-blooded killer. (A question of rights and wrongs, Open Page, The Hindu , Nov. 25). And the Judge sees injustice in his hanging. Kasab, along with nine cold-blooded fellow fanatics, kept the entire nation on tenterhooks for three days. He, with the others, came to India only to open fire indiscriminately and kill as many as he can before he dies, to fire at the unarmed innocent people with sophisticated weapons. He, together with nine others, killed 164 people! And a former Supreme Court judge tells us that we are all guilty  all of humanity that abetted his killing and burial but could not reform him. I presume that the learned judge does not recognise the basics of fanaticism, bigotry and religious terrorism. They are reformed people who sally forth to reform the world, by killing all others who dont follow their belief. They see the gateway to heaven in killing the others who dont believe in what they believe. They see salvation in killing those whom they consider infidels. We kept Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and Maulana Masood Azhar in our custody without hanging them for waging a holy war against the nation and its people. On December 24, 1999, IC 814, an Indian Airlines passenger flight, was hijacked. The 174 passengers aboard and the entire nation were on tenterhooks for seven days, till January 1, 2000. The terrorists killed 25-year old Rupin Katyal, one of the passengers. He was stabbed to death in front of his wife. They were a just married couple. The demand of the (Harkat-ul-Mujahideen) terrorists was to release Zargar, Saeed Sheikh and Azhar. And a great nation had to genuflect in front of the hijackers, five hardcore terrorists, and we escorted the three jihadists in our custody safely to Kandahar. Had we not hanged the 26/11 gunman, suppose the 1999 hijack episode repeats, what would have been the response of those who have no doubtthat Gandhijis country should not have killed Ajmal Kasab? Ask the young widow of Rupin Katyal or any of the passengers of IC 814 whether we should hang the terrorists or not. Ask them whether all of humanity is responsible for the dastardly and cold-blooded acts of the terrorists. Govindachamy, a vagabond, pushed out a young girl from a running train, and dragged the unconscious victim to a bush and raped her. She was in a coma for four days and succumbed to her head injuries. The culprit has been awarded capital punishment and I believe he deserves it. Can we say that society made Govindachamy a criminal and rapist? I cant answer the question. This question should be asked to the victims of rape. Or, at least, it should be posed to girls and women. It is easy for men to argue that Govindachamy belongs to a poor family and he is a human being and he should not be hanged. But will any girl or woman endorse it? Coming back to Kasab, suppose he was not hanged. What will we do with him? He was a human being, there is no doubt. But is he a human being fit to be alive in a civilised society? Does a human being have the right to kill others to satisfy or justify what he believes in? If a human being commits such acts, doesnt he disqualify himself to be called a human being just as the others who live and let live? Threat to civilisation When a human being disqualifies himself to be called so, he is called a criminal. And when a human being cold-bloodedly eliminates innocent human beings against whom he has no personal grudge and whom he has not even seen, he is not only a criminal but also a potential threat and danger to civilisation. I dont see any point in the argument for clemency to such elements which undermine the very foundation of humanity. Those who put forth such arguments should clearly tell us what we should do with them, and how we should reform them, instead of offering the platitudes like we are all guilty.

The Delhi Cabinet last month had given its nod to a Bill that proposed changes in the working of the DSGC by clearing the draft of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras (Amendment) Bill, 2012. The Bill, sent to the Union Home Ministry for approval, proposes a direct election for the DSMGC president and increase in the tenure of the house from two years to four years. The move has been opposed by Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal who, in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, described it as a direct interference in the religious affairs of the Sikhs. Ravi Inder Singh, head of the splinter faction Akali Dal 1920, has demanded that the SGPC Act of 1925 be amended to allow for direct election of its president. The demand is being supported by some Congressmen with former legislator Sukhpal Khaira stating, As far as the election for the office of the SGPC president is concerned, it is an open secret that the Badal father [Mr. Parkash Singh] and son [Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal] duo send a sealed envelope each November to Amritsar to have their protg elected as president. The general house of the SGPC is a mute and helpless spectator in the prestigious election. The SGPC president is imposed by the Badal family rather than being elected by members. By electing their front man as SGPC president, the Badals have done a great disservice to the community. There are reports of gross politicisation of the SGPC, corruption is rampant in the body and Sikhs are largely dissatisfied by the performance of the highest religious body. Even the appointment and selection of Jathedar Akal Takht Sahib is being doneat the whims and fancies of the Badal clan, the Congress leader added. Presently the DSMGC, which manages some 20 prominent gurdwaras in the national Capital, is controlled by the Paramjit Sarna faction of the Akali Dal which owes allegiance to the Sheila Dikshit government in Delhi. The SGPC manages some 200 historic gurdwaras in Punjab through a 160-member elected house which is dominated by the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal). Speaking to The Hindu , former SGPC secretary Manjit Singh Calcutta said: For quite some time now the Badals have been trying to gain control over Delhi gurdwaras to expand their influence and also curtail the activities of the Sarna camp, which is today the only remaining strong splinter Akali group, to challenge their hegemony. He said the Rakab Ganj clash, in which several persons were injured, took place because DSMGC general secretary Gurmeet Singh Shanti had been won over by the Badal camp, which arranged for a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket for the Delhi Municipal Corporation for his wife. The BJP is the Akali Dals alliance partner in Punjab. The November 15 meeting of the DSMGC executive committee was called to curtail some of Mr. Shantis powers as Mr. Sarna felt that he had been obstructing its work. To counter this, Mr Shanti invited Manjit Singh G.K. of the Akali Dal (Badal), which provoked the clash. DSMGC elections are due to be held next year on orders of the Supreme Court. Mr. Parkash Singh Badal has said that the ulterior motive of the Delhi Government behind the proposed amendment is to further delay the general elections of DSGMC which were scheduled to take place in January last year. If Mr. Sarna gets another two years as president, it will be advantageous for the Congress in the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections because he has considerable support among Delhis Sikhs. Ms. Dikshit, while on a visit to Ludhiana in Punjab, declared: The Cabinet has already cleared the DSMGC amendment. It will be sent to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs and I will personally make sure that the Act is ready by December. There shouldnt be any uncertainty and ambiguity on this. My suggestion to Mr. Badal is that he should not interfere in elections which are not taking place in his State. Many amendments were made to the 1971 Act even by the BJP-led government in Delhi, she added. Earlier this month, Mr. Sukhbir Badal who was visiting the Pakistan Punjab surprised his hosts by suggesting that they consider handing over the running of Pakistans gurdwaras to the SGPC. Pakistan has its own gurdwara committee which manages most of the historic gurdwaras located in its Punjab province. Many of these which were closed since the Partition have re-opened in the last two decades. A gurdwara at Guru Ramdass birthplace near Lahore was opened due to the initiative of the DSMGC some years ago.

According to media reports, the incident took place on January 12 off Pudukottai coast. Fishermen accused the island Navy of having opened fire on them. In a breakfast chat with foreign correspondents at his Temple Trees residence here, Mr. Rajapaksa said the Navy was not involved. Asked whether Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had spoken to him about the incident, Mr. Rajapaksa replied in the negative. Asked if Colombo would take action if it was proved its security forces had a hand in the incident, he said that despite the preliminary investigation establishing that the Navy had no role, he had asked the Navy Commander to conduct a thorough investigation. Discussions were under way to prevent such incidents. We have had arrangements earlier but these will have to be revised given the new peaceful situation in Sri Lanka, the President said. On High Commissioner Prasad Kariyawasam being summoned by the Indian government, Mr. Rajapaksa said New Delhi had the right to do so and even Colombo would take similar action in such situations. We do not have any problem with that, the President said. The Navy's chief of operations, Commodore Neil Rosayro, said the incident occurred well within Indian waters. The sea is very shallow in these areas and the positions of all our ships are monitored by land-based and other equipment. This is in the open and anyone can check, he told The Hindu, denying that the Navy was to blame. In the past the two Navies discussed coordinated patrolling and even carried it out for a while. But the problem is when 300-400 of Indian fishing boats come into the Sri Lankan waters, what can we do, he asked. When the war was on, and, before that, when the LTTE was dominant, instances of Indian fishermen venturing close to the Sri Lankan waters were fewer. Now more boats were encroaching with each passing day, Commodore Rosayro said and added that the representatives of the Navies were regularly in touch to prevent any untoward incident.

        "content": " The womens helpline number, 1091, launched here with much fanfare on Thursday, seems to be facing technical glitches and Home Minister R. Ashoks hard sell about police rushing to rescue women in distress rings hollow. When The Hindu team visited some of the crowded places in the city over two days and spotted instances of sexual harassment, it called the helpline number, which invariably remained busy for more than 15 minutes. Moreover, the police did not turn up at the spot for even half an hour after the complaint was finally made. Call 100 instead When a call was made to the helpline about a girl being harassed by a few youths near Vasanthnagar, the voice at the other end assured that the police would reach the spot in 10 minutes. However, nobody turned up even after an hour. A reporter who apprised a policeman in the area was told: Dont call the helpline; call 100 instead. The helpline is still new. Another team, which visited the Shivajinagar bus-stop, spotted two men on a two-wheeler passing lewd comments on girls who passed by. The helpline said a Hoysala patrol would arrive in 10 minutes. The 10 minutes extended to 30 before the team left in disgust. A person at the helpline claimed the helpline had received a good response as they got over 1,000 calls on Friday. However, she also admitted to technical problems and said there were only two lines for the helpline number. She said: We are getting complaints from callers that calls from only BSNL (landline and mobile phones) are getting through. But we have been getting calls from other service providers also. We will streamline the process in a week. Although the papers clearly state that the helpline is only for women in Bangalore, we have been getting calls from several districts such as Koppal and Bidar as well. When asked for the nature of the complaints, she said: We have been getting calls for dowry harassment. A schoolgirl also called to inform that there were men who were following her. We have asked them to call us the moment they face trouble. From men too She added that a majority of the callers had called to check if the helpline was functional. Interestingly, the helpline has also received calls from men. One man called us to tell us to do something for men as well and alleged that he was harassed by a woman! Shocked at the lukewarm response received from the helpline, some women spoke about the need to streamline the protocol, pointing out some pockets in the city were unsafe for women. Sahana Domic, a management student at Mount Carmel College, said: Last week a group of boys groped one of my friends on Vasanthnagar main road at noon. This area is certainly not safe. Another student said it was ridiculous that the helpline could be reached only from a BSNL landline or a mobile number. Well sort it out Responding to this, Additional Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) T. Suneel Kumar said the technical problems would be rectified. As the helpline was launched only on Thursday, we need to sort things out. Asked why the police did not reach the spot after the complaints were made at the helpline, he said the police would upgrade the process.  OPEN",

        "content": " A court here on Saturday took cognisance of the charge sheet filed by the police in the Delhi gang-rape case and issued production warrants to summon the five accused from the Tihar Central Jail on Monday to start pre-trial proceedings. Additional Public Prosecutor Rajiv Mohan told the court that the Delhi Central Forensic Science Laboratorys DNA report indicated that the victims blood samples tallied with the blood stains on the clothes of all the accused. A piece of the victims dress, which one of the accused had burnt, was recovered from the ashes at his instance, and blood stains on it tallied with her blood sample. Metropolitan Magistrate Namrita Aggarwal said that prima facie offences under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 376(2)(g) (gang rape), 377 (unnatural offences), 365 (kidnapping), 394 (causing hurt in committing robbery), 395 (dacoity), 396 (dacoity with murder), 201 (destruction of evidence), 120B (conspiracy), 34 (common intention) and 412 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of the Indian Penal Code were made out against all the accused. On Monday, copies of the charge sheet would be supplied to Ram Singh, Mukesh Singh, Pawan Kumar, Akshay Singh and Vinay Sharma. The committing of the case to the sessions fast-track court would depend on the time taken for scrutiny of documents. The sixth accused is being treated as a juvenile and the investigating officer is expected to appear before a Juvenile Justice Board on Monday afternoon. After filing an electronic copy of the charge sheet in court, Mr. Mohan said statements of the physiotherapy student and her male friend, the DNA report furnished by CFSL, Delhi, and medical records from Safdarjung Hospital supported the charges that the Delhi Police wanted framed against the accused. The girl died due to septicaemia arising from multiple organ failure caused by multiple injuries. The death summary submitted by the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore, was correlated by Safdarjung Hospital, where she had been treated till December 26. Mr. Mohan said the charges of dacoity, dacoity with murder, and causing hurt while committing robbery on December 16 last were supported by the fact that the accused were more than five in number and articles they robbed from the two victims were recovered at their own instance. The charge sheet, which names 80 witnesses and contains a list of 12 items of evidence, was ordered to be kept sealed upon the prosecution request to protect the girls identity. Mr. Mohan later told journalists that the post-mortem report was expected by January 20 and it would reveal the brutality of the crime and the manner in which it was committed. The police were waiting for a report on tooth bites inflicted by the girl on three of the accused while she fought to save herself. The police would take some more time to file the charge sheet against the juvenile accused as the court concerned would first go through the bone ossification test report and related documents to be sure of his age, the prosecutor said. Meanwhile, a man in saffron robes, claiming to be the founder of an organisation for rape victims, moved an application in the same court praying that details of the victim be made public and the copies of the charge sheet be supplied to the media. When Mr. Mohan asked him what his locus was to intervene in the matter, he told the magistrate: I am a citizen of India and the girl who was gang-raped and murdered was a daughter of the nation. Her male friend had appeared on television yesterday [Friday]. So there is nothing to hide now. The prosecutor sought dismissal of the application and informed the court that a case had been lodged against the news channel which aired the interview of the male friend. The police faced embarrassment in court when they pointed out to the magistrate that the most important charge  Section 302  was inadvertently left out on the cover page of the charge sheet.

There were four employees at the site, two of them died in the blast and the other two who were seriously injured were shifted to a hospital here. Two casual workers were also injured. Narsipatnam RDO Vasantarayulu told mediapersons at Nakkapalli that the company had identified the victims as B Jayadheer Rao of Sattupalli, who worked as chemist, and K Tirupati Rao of Makkuva, technician. The critically injured have been identified as G Venkat Rao and KG Papa Rao. Two others who are being treated at the same hospital are Chintala Demudu and M Naveen, both casual workers. According to an eyewitness, the 20 persons who work at the site had gone to the canteen and escaped unhurt. This is the first time a mishap has occurred in the unit that went on stream in 2007, according to company sources. Minister for Tribal Welfare P. Balaraju and district Collector V. Seshadri visited the hospital. Minister for Infrastructure and Investments Ganta Srinivasa Rao asked the Collector and Factories Department officials to take up relief measures. He is expected to visit the plant on Sunday morning. Mr. Balaraju said if required they would suspend the licence of Hetero Drugs Limited, which owns the Pharma City.

The measures came after a meeting between Education Minister T. Thiagarajan and principals in the wake of the rape of a 17-year-old student by two men on Tuesday. By reducing contact between boys and girls, it was possible to prevent basic misbehaviour and it would also reduce temptation, said an Education Department official. Instead of dupatta, a student should wear an overcoat. Squads would be formed to check use of mobile phones by students, Secretary of Education G. Ragesh Chandra told The Hindu . These guidelines were for both private and government schools and a similar meeting with college principals would be held next week, he said. During the meeting, the principals emphasised need for greater interaction of parents and teachers, advanced intimation to parents if special classes were conducted and maintenance of a record of the mobile phones of parents and guardians so that they could be informed if their wards were not present.

Though the post-mortem report has not conclusively confirmed rape and the vaginal swab report of the victim is awaited, the police have registered a case under Sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape) and 201 (disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. The murder came to light when an unidentified man rang up the Police Control Room saying a young woman was lying dead near Chotpur village. A PCR van along with a forensic team reached the spot and found the partially covered body of the girl with strangulation marks around the neck. She was later identified as a resident of Chotpur. The girl, who worked as a tailor in a nearby garments factory, left for home as usual after working hours, but did not reach home. When she could not be located, the family approached the police. The body was spotted by some locals. Police sources said the girl usually carried a mobile phone along but left the gadget behind on Friday morning as it was not charged. The victim left home at 8.30 a.m. on Friday for work. After the working hours were over, she took an auto rickshaw on her way back and was dropped some distance away from her home. The garments factory records show that the victim left the factory at 8.55 p.m., the sources added. Two persons have been detained and are being interrogated. We have definite leads and hope to crack the case in 24 hours, said Senior Superintendent of Police (Noida) Praveen Kumar. Family members, relatives and neighbours of the victim staged a protest on the National Highway-24 demanding prompt action by the police.  OPEN",

The police said whether or not the girl had been raped could only be established after post-mortem. The girls mother said that she had left home 8.30 a.m. on Friday to work at a call centre in Sector 65, where she had the 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. shift.

Outside Chotpur colony, her colleagues went their separate ways and she proceeded towards her house but never reached there. When her daughter did not return till 10 p.m., a search was conducted. Policemen said the woman may have eloped with a boyfriend, and refused to take the matter seriously.

        "content": " They completed their Bachelor of Nautical Science with dreams in their eyes and a loan on their shoulders. They then paid lakhs to a dubious employment agent, hoping to earn a good job on board a safe vessel. Their dreams are shattered today, some have even thought of committing suicide, even as the agent seems to continue running his racket with impunity. He is very shrewd. He knows that those staying in Mumbai will call his bluff soon and will make it difficult for him to operate. So he approaches only students like us who are from outside the city or the State. There are many students from Lucknow, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, and Kolkata who are still waiting in the hope that Pawan Brar will return their money. He probably knows well that it is difficult for us to identify the other victims. Forget our coming together, filing a complaint and following it up, said 20-year-old Babu Raghavan from Chennai said. He and his friends have completed B.Sc. (Nautical Science) from AMET University in Chennai. Just last year Pawan Brar, believed to be in his 20s, was arrested by the Mumbai Police, along with his accomplice, for duping two students from Vellore in Tamil Nadu after sending an e-mail about fake job opportunities to their college. But he was released later. Elaborate trap This time, it seems, he laid a more elaborate trap. He, along with his unknown accomplices, allegedly built a fake website www.pacificship.in (shown to be under construction), created fake official email ids, gave out a false RPSL number (the Recruitment and Placement Services Licence is mandated by the Directorate General of Shipping for authorised recruiters and agents), and built a fake Facebook page in the name of Pacific Ship India Pvt. Ltd. Last year, he sent spurious mails to lure students. This year he reached them by word of mouth  thanks to dubious sub-agents and students. The self-appointed Director of Pacific Ship (India) Pvt. Ltd. GERMAN has so far duped at least 30 students, of more than Rs. 1 crore, extracting anything between Rs. 1.5 lakh and Rs. 3.5 lakh from each of them. The number is expected to rise after many other unsuspecting students across the country come forth and complain. Meanwhile, the seven youths from Tamil Nadu who were duped have decided to pursue the matter. We were completely lured by his sweet talk. He initially gave us false reasons why our contracts were being cancelled. We never signed any contract. He just sent us a fake one-page appointment letter. None of the papers he gave us has any registration number. He kept telling us that his RPSL number is being renewed by DG Shipping and will take time. He was very convincing, said Arumugam Dinesh Kumar, who hails from Madurai. An Internet search throws up only a .pdf format form designed by Pacific Ship (India) Pvt. Ltd. GERMAN. The telephone numbers given there are either unreachable or keep ringing incessantly. Sources in the shipping industry say if an agency has received a valid RPSL number, it will not take the DG Shipping more than two or three working days to update the information on its website. But it has been months since Brar claimed that his company received RPSL number 232  a number which does not exist in the DG Shippings list of authorised agents for recruitment and placement services. His office premises, a small rented room at Goregaon, have been locked since the time outstation students started making a beeline there to claim their money. That place now houses a travel agencys office. The Kurar police have registered a case of cheating against him, but he is still at large.

Mr. Malik, who called on Dr. Singh at his official residence, invited him to visit Pakistan. He told him that soon a Pakistani judicial commission would come to India, a process that would fast-track the trial. His [Dr. Singhs] point of view was that my people here ask what you have done for the people who suffered during 26/11. We have given him a commitment to send a judicial commission here...It was a very good meeting, he told journalists. It is learnt that Pakistan has agreed to let a team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which probes the case, visit the country early next year. Mr. Malik, who met National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon and Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Friday, said: Whatever trust deficit was there, it was removed. Let the Director-General of the FIA [Pakistans Federal Investigation Agency] and the NIA sit together and resolve the issues, he said. The NIA wants to visit Pakistan to examine the evidence collected by its agencies against the accused, including the mastermind of the attacks and Jamaat-ud-Dawa founder Hafiz Saeed. Similarly, a Pakistani judicial commission is likely to visit India later this month to cross-examine the witnesses, so that their statements could be presented as proof against the accused. However, Mr. Malik said Saeed could not be arrested until India gave hard and substantive evidence. The Pakistani government was trying to fast-track his case, as an application had been filed in the Lahore High Court. Referring to Indias demand for the voice samples of terrorists who directed the attackers from a control room in Pakistan, Mr. Malik said that as per Pakistans law, the voice sample could not be given unless permission was given by the accused himself. We have moved the High Court in the matter of [Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Zaki-ur Rehman] Lakhvis voice sample, and it is pending there. Government sources say that when he was Home Minister, P. Chidambaram refused to host Mr. Malik until Pakistan handed over the voice samples and showed signs of fast-tracking the trial. As a result, the formalisation of new visa regime was delayed. This time too, some senior Ministers were not happy with Mr. Maliks visit, especially because of the lack of cooperation in the 26/11 case.  OPEN",

The partys call for a Bihar bandh received a poor response on Saturday. It [bandh] is necessary for Bihar. People are dying after consuming illicit as well as licit liquor. We cannot tolerate this. This government runs on liquor mafia. Profits to liquor mafia are several times larger than the revenue earned through the sale of alcohol, Deepankar Bhattacharya, general secretary of CPI-ML (Liberation), said. Keeping in mind the interest of the poor, women and people at large, the government should implement total prohibition in the State, he said. There is more response to the bandh in the districts. If you ask women, doctors, teachers, all will support the demand for prohibition. This is an issue of public health and social security. Liquor consumption is rampant across all villages. Today liquor means corruption; liquor means death in Bihar. CPI (M-L) leader Meena Tiwari said the liquor mafia was enjoying State protection. Spurious liquor is being sold through licensed shops. The line between licit and illicit liquor has been obfuscated, she told The Hindu . Ashi Devi, a CPI (M-L) leader of Sihi panchayat in Patna district, said the police took action only against a handful of poor people who brewed liquor, but took no action against illicit liquor manufactured and distributed through government units.

        "content": " India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives will soon sign a trilateral agreement on maritime cooperation to pool resources and share data for better control over territorial waters and detect suspicious movements. Informing this at a maritime security seminar, Galle Dialogue, here, Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said Sri Lanka, India and the Maldives had been working on a trilateral agreement for cooperation in carrying out surveillance, anti-piracy operations and in curbing illegal activities, including maritime pollution. A key aspect of information sharing is Maritime Domain Awareness. Meetings have already been held at the ministerial and at technical levels, and we hope the Memorandum of Understanding will be signed in the near future. I am confident that multilateral agreements of this nature will be greatly instrumental in curbing many of the issues that the naval powers in the region face, he said. Noting that nearly half of the worlds containerised cargo crosses the Indian Ocean every year, Mr. Gotabaya wanted better cooperation among the bigger and smaller navies in the region. Unfortunately, there is a degree of mistrust between the major powers in the Indian Ocean region that now limits the degree to which effective and long-lasting multilateral cooperation can be achieved, he said. Detailing the Indian efforts in the region, Vice-Chief of the Naval Staff R.K. Dhowan pointed out that piracy emanating from Somalia had been confined to 700 nautical miles, largely due to the effective patrolling and cooperation among the navies. India too had contributed significantly to this effort and had so far repulsed 40 pirate attacks. India had also agreements with Royal Thai and the Indonesian naval forces to conduct coordinated patrolling in the east, around the region of the Malacca Straits. In an effort at ensuring better coordination and shorten response timings during a crisis, India has posted a Military Attach (MA) in the Maldives. So far, the MA based in Sri Lanka was also in charge of the Maldives. Captain R.S. Sunil, based at the Eastern Naval Command Headquarters at Visakhapatnam, took charge as MA last week at Male. He is the first MA to be based in the Maldives. India trains the Maldivian National Defence Forces and its police. Only India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and China have diplomatic posts in the Maldives. All the others either operate out of Colombo or New Delhi.

Neela, Janawadi Mahila Sanghatane vice-president, said, in Bidar on Saturday. She was speaking at the first district conference of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU). Rise in crimes against women is due to failure of the policing system. In just two years, there have been 27 rapes in Bidar district alone. Can the police announce how many offenders have been arrested or punished? she asked. She demanded that the police release a report on action taken in all the rape cases in the district, along with the annual crime figures. This will hold the police accountable, she said. She urged the government to protect the witnesses in sexual assault cases. The State government should monitor whether the social justice committees at the zilla and gram panchayats are working properly. These committees are supposed to see if there have any atrocities on Dalits and Adivasis in their jurisdiction. But these committees dont hold regular meetings, she said. She pointed out that the low sex ratio was also among the reasons for the rising crimes against women. The lesser the number of women in society, the more unsafe it is for them, she said. This can be checked by stopping selective abortions, she said. If only pre-natal sex determination committees at the district worked properly, this country would not have had such a skewed sex ratio, Ms. Neela said. She said that the government was responsible for the safety of women and had to put in place a strong mechanism that ensured that sexual offenders were brought to justice. She demanded action against police officials who refused to register rape cases. She also sought action against politicians and others who try to hush up cases of sexual assault. Rapes are very different from other crimes. A rape makes the victim all through her life, she said. She said that JMS will organise a rally in protest against rise in crimes against women in Bidar in the second week of January. The main aim of this rally would be to demand justice to the five-year-old rape victim from Saigaon in Bhalki. She criticised RSS leader Mohan Bhagawat for stating rapes occurred only in urban area. This only showed that he did not understand India, she said.  OPEN",

        "content": " Sunday morning saw a car chase, the arrest of four men in connection with a murder and the discovery that the plot for the killing had been hatched in prison. Police said that with these arrests, the murder of V.N. Palayam, a member of the Republican Party of India, who had been attacked on April 5, was solved. On April 5, Palayam had been returning home on his motorcycle after dropping his daughter off at school. Around 8.30 a.m., when he was in Annai Velankani Nagar, he was intercepted by six men on three motorcycles. The men attacked him with sickles, left him on the road, and sped away. Palayam was first admitted to the Government Stanley Hospital and later shifted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, where he died on Sunday. A case had initially been registered under section 307 (attempt to murder), which was then changed to section 302 (murder.) Four teams headed by S. Jayakumar, additional deputy commissioner (Pulianthope) were formed to crack the murder. On Friday, five of those accused in the case, surrendered in different courts across the city. During our investigation, we found out that apart from the six men on motorcycles, three others too, had been involved in the murder. After five of them surrendered, we launched a hunt for the other four  Selvakumar (26) of Vyasarpadi, Vivekananadan (44) of Madhavaram, Tamilarasan (26) Royapuram and Baskaran (25) of Vyasarpadi, said Jayakumar. On Sunday, the police received a tip stating the four men had bee spotted in Madhavaram. As soon as we got there, we saw them on motorcycles. We went after them in our car, and after about a half-kilometre chase, we managed to nab them, said Jayakumar. When the men were interrogated, they told police that the murder had been had been committed mainly for business purposes. Apart from being involved in politics, Palayam was a sub-contractor at the goods shed in Vyasarpadi where goods that come by train are loaded and unloaded. It is a highly remunerative job. As his contract was about to expire, Nagendran a notorious history-sheeter, who is at present serving a life sentence at the Vellore prison, wanted to take it over, said Jayakumar. At this juncture, three persons  Selvakumar, Baskaran and Tamilarasan  were sent to Puzhal prison in connection with another murder case. Once there, they requested prison officers to shift them to the Vellore prison, saying their lives were in danger at Puzhal as a rival gang was also lodged there. Once in Vellore, they met up with Nagendran and hatched the plan, said Govi Manoharan, assistant commissioner of police, MKB Nagar. Nagendran told the men to get in touch with his friends  Karthik, Vivekanandan, Vikram, Vinod Kumar, Gandhi and Prakash. Once the three were out on bail, the nine of them got together and murdered Palayam, Manoharan said. With the surrender of five of the men on Friday and Sundays arrest of the other four, all the accused have now been held, Manoharan added.  With Sundays arrests, all of the accused in the killing have now been nabbed  OPEN",

In Ambala, local leader Narinder Singh was crushed to death under the wheels of a State-owned roadways bus, which he and his fellow protesters attempted to stop. The strike call evoked mixed response across the country on Wednesday. The functioning of banks, insurance companies, transport, coal, telecom and oil industries, central and State government undertakings, and Central/State government offices in many places was affected. Kerala, Tripura, Bihar were among the worst-affected States. In Delhi, government offices functioned as usual but not many autos or taxis were seen on the road. In some States there was only lukewarm response. Stray incidents of violence occurred in Odisha and Karnataka. There was only partial response in Tamil Nadu with shops open as usual, and taxis and auto-rickshaws plying normally in some cities. Workers took out rallies, held protest meetings, dharnas near their place of work in various cities across the country. Commuters, patients, students, vendors, and those arriving at or going to airports, bus stands, railway stations and offices were put to great hardship due to non-availability of transport in many places. Similarly Industries faced production loss. However, flight and train operations remained unaffected. The unions were demanding, among other things, check on price rise, more employment generation, better social security to the unorganised workers, ban on contract labour system, and fixing minimum wages at Rs. 10,000 a month. Unprecedented AITUC general secretary and CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta claimed that the strike was unprecedented and received massive response on day one. It reflected the peoples anger against the government and its policies, he said.

Ms. Jayalalithaa could become the Prime Minister if the party won all the 40 seats, he said. Mr. Viswanathan wondered when Chandrasekhar and I.K.

With 12 people rescued we still have 58 missing,\" rescue official Rebekka Gultom said, adding that figures included crew members. Search and rescue officials originally said on Sunday that only 27 people had been on board and that 12 had been rescued. The actual figure was got only after families of those missing reported to them. \"We have deployed a total of eight rescue boats to search for the missing, from maritime police, navy and (the) search agency.\" No bodies had so far been recovered, she said. The boat, which was also carrying food and building materials, left Ambon city in the Maluku islands, late Saturday. It was lashed by towering waves and strong winds two hours into its journey to Namrole town on the island of Buru. Transport ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan said that the boat, which has a gross tonnage of 84 tonnes, was not a passenger boat. \"It's actually meant to carry logistics to remote areas in the Maluku islands, but sometimes people get on the boat to ferry them home,\" he said. Indonesia's 240 million people are spread across more than 17,000 islands and are heavily dependent on a network of ships and boats, which have a poor safety record.AFP  OPEN",

        "content": " Kannada writer H.S. Shivaprakash has submitted his resignation to the membership of Kannada Sahitya Academy in protest against the dissolution of the Karnataka Urdu Academy by Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa on November 10. Mr. Shivaprakash, Dean, School of Arts and Aesthetics, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, who was here on a personal visit, expressed regret over the development and sent his resignation letter to the chairman of the Kannada Sahitya Academy. In his letter, he noted that by dissolving the Urdu Academy without assigning specific reasons, the Government had created a dangerous precedent. Regretting the decision, he said that he could not recall this kind of action by any of the governments that had ruled the States so far. There was no instance of even new governments dissolving academies appointed by the previous governments after coming to power, he noted. By dissolving the academy constituted by it, the present Government had set a dangerous precedent that would affect the autonomy of the institution. Any government can emulate this. To protest against the action of the Government, I am submitting my resignation, he said. With the resignation of Mr. Shivaprakash, the controversy surrounding the dissolution of the Urdu Academy by the Government has taken a new twist. Disclosing the Government's decision on November 10, Minister for Minorities Welfare and Haj Mumtaz Ali Khan had said that the Karnataka Urdu Academy was dissolved, its chairman and members were dismissed, as its chairman Khaleel Mamoon was functioning in an arrogant manner without involving the Kannada and Culture Department, although the academy was a part of it. The Minister also accused Mr. Mamoon of announcing the World Urdu Conference, framing programmes and formulating committees, visiting New Delhi and inviting the Prime Minister for the inaugural without informing the Chief Minister, the Minister or officials of the department. The Government also appointed Haafiz Amjad Hussain Haafiz Karnataki as new chairman of the academy. When contacted, Mr. Mamoon clarified that he had communicated to Mr. Yeddyurappa, who was holding Kannada and Culture portfolio then, the plans of the academy to conduct the conference in August. He had even appealed to him to release Rs. 3.50 crore for the conference, he said. He had also informed Govind M. Karjol of the plans of the academy to hold the conference, after the latter assumed the charge of the department. But there was no response from the two of them, he said. He also said that he had visited New Delhi to invite the Prime Minister to inaugurate the meet. He had invited BJP leaders, including Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley, to the valedictory. He had also made former Chief Minister N. Dharam Singh Chairman of the Organising Committee, in view of his scholarship in Urdu language. It seems visiting Delhi and seeking funds from various academies have irked the Government which had dissolved the academy, he regretted. Accusing the government of interfering with an autonomous cultural body, Mr. Mamoon approached court questioning the decision of the government and the court had ordered status quo in the case. The Government cannot appoint members in view of the court order, he noted. The Government has created a dangerous precedent'   I am submitting my resignation in protest'  OPEN",

Deve Gowda on Friday accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government of denying social justice to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the zilla and taluk panchayat elections. Speaking to presspersons at Paduvalahippe village of Holenarsipur taluk in Hassan district after exercising his franchise, he alleged that by reducing the reservation quota for OBCs, the BJP Government had done injustice to the backward classes and undermined the purpose of decentralisation of power. As the elections are over, the Government should try to correct the mistake committed at least in the coming elections, he noted. When his reaction was sought on the visit of Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley to Bangalore, he said that Mr. Jaitley visited Bangalore to protect Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa. Despite the media exposing series of scams', the Chief Minister is sticking to power, without an iota of shame, he noted. On Mr. Yeddyurappa's statement of bringing a book on the wealth allegedly amassed through illegal means by Mr. Deve Gowda's family, he said that he did not have any objection and Mr. Yeddyurappa was free to write anything. Instead of probing into the assets of my family, let him order a probe into the wealth amassed in Shimoga, he retorted. On the controversy surrounding 2G Spectrum issue, he said that there was nothing wrong in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appearing before Public Accounts Committee.

        "content": " Comptroller and Auditor General of India has detected gross irregularities in selection of developers and award of port projects in the State. Out of five port projects proposed under public private partnership mode, in four cases developers were selected through MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) mode based on suo motu offers despite Law Department recommending for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), alleges CAGs general and social sector report, which was laid in the State Assembly on Saturday. One developer for Gopalpur Port was selected based on ICB process, while for other four projects such as Astaranga, Chudamani, Dhamra and Subarnarekha were entertained through MoU route based on suo motu offers from private companies, it says. While a single suo motu offer was received in each case of three projects (Chudamani, Dhamra, and Subarnarekha), two offers were received for Astaranga Port. According to report, the grounds indicated by applicants in the suo motu offers were past experience in successful implementation of minor ports elsewhere, execution of several prestigious projects as well as being marine construction and iron ore mining companies. CAG commented that, there was nothing on record in the files of the Commerce and Transport Department to indicate as to whether the department had made any efforts to ascertain about other players who would be interested for these projects. When auditors sought explanation from the C&T Department as to why bidding process was not preferred, the department replied, after two and a half years of advertisement of the port policy in the website, only three developers had given their proposal for development of Astaranga, Chudamani, and Subarnarekha  single proposal for each location and no other party came forward to develop these port locations for which government signed MoU with the developers of these port projects. CAG, however, did not accept the reply. Procedures such as posting on website are not substitute for competitive bidding. While investor meets are mechanism for making possible bidders aware about the offer, a tender for competitive bidding expresses the intention of the government to get into legally valid and enforceable contractual relationship. No effort was made to ascertain availability of other interested parties for these ports, the auditing agency said. It pointed out that in case of Gopalpur Port, 14 bidders showed their interest when competitive bidding was adopted. The government should have gone for ICB in case of Astaranga, Chudamandi, and Subarnarekha ports excepting for Dharmra Port for which MoU was signed in March 1997, the CAG pointed out. CAG has exposed another serious irregularity. No scale was prescribed for assessing the land requirement for minor ports. Whatever land the developer requested was agreed to by the government. It recommended land being scarce source, excess land alienated beyond requirement of should be restored to government. Procedures such as posting on website are not substitute for competitive bidding, says CAGState should have gone for ICB in case of Astaranga, Chudamandi, and Subarnarekha ports Procedures such as posting on website are not substitute for competitive bidding, says CAG State should have gone for ICB in case of Astaranga, Chudamandi, and Subarnarekha ports  OPEN",

Our investigation has proved that this elephant had not fallen prey to any electrical trap set by poachers, he added. As per the DFO, the dead elephant was over 30 years in age. It was part of a herd of 13 elephants. The herd was moving towards Phulbani forest division in Kandhamal district when the recent mishap occurred. According to forest officials who made on the spot enquiry, for some reason this herd had tried to show off their strength of two electrical poles which supported naked cables carrying high voltage electricity. Both electric poles were bent down due to which the electricity supply cable had touched the body of the dead female elephant. With the help of veterinary surgeons autopsy of the dead elephant was conducted. The post mortem also confirmed that death of the elephant was due to electrocution. It may be noted that electricity has been a major danger for wild elephants in Ganjam district. Fiveelephantshad been electrocuted to death in the district by electric traps set by poachers in the last one month. Poachers had connected their traps to the overhead power supply cables that pass through jungles.

The childs family said she was kidnapped by an unidentified man seen in a share autorickshaw. The families have been pavement-dwellers outside the Sri Padala Ponniamman Thirukkoil, intermittently, for the last 25 years and were making a living by doing menial jobs. The children are often seen playing on the one-way road amidst danger of oncoming traffic . Many efforts by the police to evacuate them from the spot have failed. I was sleeping outside the temple with one child sleeping inside the mosquito net and the other sleeping outside, next to me. I noticed a share autorickshaw with a skinny man parked nearby for a long time. Around 3 a.m., I opened my eyes and found the girl next to me missing and the vehicle speeding away, said Kalaiarasi, who finds it hard to move due to a C-section delivery of the twins. Kalaiarasi raised an alarm and her family members and relatives, who were asleep on the road, started a search. However, they were unable to locate the vehicle. They alerted the police who reached the spot and carried out preliminary investigations. The twins were yet to be christened and the missing child was undergoing treatment after suffering dog-bites four days ago.

The girl was rescued in a joint raid by the Gurgaon Police and non-government organisation Shakti Vahini. The 15-year-old girl was trafficked from her native place allegedly by one Meenu who took her to Gaya in Bihar. After staying there for two days, Meenu brought the girl to Delhi. One more woman along with two girls accompanied Meenu from Bihar. On reaching Delhi, Meenu allegedly handed over the girl to Baburaj, who runs a placement agency in Shakurpur. The girl purportedly revealed during counselling that she was beaten up by Baburaj for no reason. Baburaj supplied her as a domestic help in Punjabi Bagh a few days later and recently placed her in the house of a doctor in Gurgaon. On Wednesday, the girl managed to make a call to her mother in her native village and her mother in turn informed the local police. The Kalchini police station officer in-charge contacted us and told us about the girl. We then carried out a joint raid with the police and rescued the girl. The girl had gone missing from her house in January 13, but her family was too scared to report the matter to the police, said Shakti Vahini activist Rishi Kant. The girl was taken to hospital after being rescued and then given shelter at a childrens home.  OPEN",

Lakshminarayan about the two officials, the councillor also lodged a complaint against them with the Bangalore Metropolitan Task Force (BMTF). In his complaint letter, Mr. Ramesh alleged that M. Raghu, assistant engineer in the project division in BBMPs south zone, and M. Lakkappa, assistant controller of finance (ACF) in the same zone, caused loss of lakhs to the BBMP. Citing one instance, he claimed Mr. Raghu illegally sold 22.88 tonnes of scrap metal retrieved after demolition of the Puttanna theatre in Jayanagar Shopping Complex. Mr. Ramesh told The Hindu that the scrap metal was worth around Rs. 18 lakh and alleged that the official had pocketed it. The complex is being developed jointly by the BBMP and Bangalore Development Authority (BDA). The BDA handed over the scrap material to the official on October 5, 2012. To dispose of it, the official should have issued notification in a Kannada and English daily, auctioned it and deposited the amount in the BBMPs accounts. None of these procedures were followed, he charged. He claimed Mr. Raghu also connived with Mr. Lakkappa to illegally cash the cheques issued to four contractors for projects taken up in Sunkenahalli, J.P. Nagar and Shakambarinagar wards, for around Rs. 30 lakh. When this came to light, the Deputy Commissioner (South) issued a show cause notice to Mr. Raghu on August 3. Mr. Ramesh alleged that Mr. Raghu had forged the signatures of the contractors, opened accounts in their (contractors) names and drawn the cheques illegally. This, he claimed, had been done for 18 small projects worth more than Rs. 1 crore. The show cause notice has been issued only for four cases. The files pertaining to 14 projects are missing. The official has remained absent for over a month, he added. Mr. Lakshminarayan said he had directed Additional Commissioner (Administration) to look into the allegations.  OPEN",

So far, we have only expressed our willingness for unconditional talks. A formal decision is yet to be announced.

Mr. Rajkhowa requested the government to release two other top leaders of the outfit lodged in the Guwahati jail  self-styled foreign secretary Sasha Choudhury and finance secretary Chitraban Hazarika. The ULFA chief also urged all concerned to take steps to facilitate participation of general secretary Anup Chetia  who was under detention in Bangladesh  in the talks process. Mr. Rajkhowa became the seventh top ULFA leader to be released on bail. Mass demand The ULFA chairman said their release had been made possible only because of mass demand raised from the platform of the SJA and the positive response by the Assam government. There is no division in ULFA over the principle of talks, he asserted in reference to media reports that the self-styled commander-in-chief Paresh Barua was still not coming forward for talks.

He, however, said the government would not object to the holding of rallies by those who had already come forward for talks, provided their speeches were limited to the peace process. Mr. Rajkhowa, accompanied by his wife Kaberi Kachari, elder brother Ajay Rajkonwar, vice-chairman Pradip Gogoi and a host of relatives and supporters, was escorted to his native place Ujanji Konwar Gaon in Sivasagar district in a convoy of vehicles. En route, he stopped at several places where he was greeted by ULFA supporters and sympathisers.  OPEN",

        "content": " Terming the closure report filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the Aarushi-Hemraj murder case as an attempt to cover up its failure to solve the case, Rebecca John, lawyer of the young girl's parents, on Saturday said the agency was indulging in malicious prosecution. The closure report purportedly mentions Aarushi's father Rajesh Talwar as the only suspect in the case. It also reportedly mentions certain circumstances which according to the CBI remained unexplained during investigations and raised doubts over Dr. Talwar's conduct. One of the reported conclusions cited in the report is that the two murders were in all probability committed by someone present in the house, which was not broken into by anyone on the fateful night. However, the CBI team previously probing the case had concluded that Dr. Talwar's domestic help Krishna, his family friend Durranis' domestic help Raj Kumar and Vijay Mandal had gained entry into the house and committed the murders. The report also purportedly mentions that the door to the terrace -- where Hemraj's body was discovered -- never used to be locked earlier. However, Ms. John pointed out that after Aarushi's murder was reported a large number of policemen visited the house. No one had stopped them from breaking the door to check the terrace. Moreover, there was another door to the terrace that could have been used by them, she said. Statutory function' To the purported allegation that attempts had been made to influence the doctor who conducted post-mortem on Aarushi's body, Ms. John said: Conducting post-mortem is a statutory function of the doctor of a government hospital. If a doctor gives such a statement, he admits to making a false report. Has the CBI recommended any action against the doctor? It is merely using his statement selectively to cover up its inadequacies. It is being said that some phone calls were made to the doctor by a relative of the Talwar family. In that case, the CBI could have easily found evidence to establish it, said Ms. John, adding that the mere fact that the two CBI teams had reached diametrically opposite conclusions about the role of Aarushi's father and the three suspects, Krishna, Raj Kumar and Vijay Mandal who were arrested by the previous team, was enough to prove that the investigations conducted by the agency could not be relied upon. Ms. John said that towards the end of the report the CBI itself has conceded that it does not have any material to corroborate most of the allegations it has made in the previous half of the report. My responses are based on whatever has been flashed in the media over the past couple of days, she added. Meanwhile, Krishna, Raj Kumar and Vijay Mandal, who purportedly have been found innocent by the second CBI team, are contemplating legal action against the agency for falsely implicating them. Their lawyer has applied for an official copy of the closure report. The three may seek compensation from the CBI.  OPEN",

The accused, Vience Raj, 31, of Karnataka, an engineering graduate with an MBA degree, was earlier arrested by the Bangalore police on a similar charge five years ago, CCS DCP P.J. Victor said. Raj worked as Human Resources executive with a multi-national company for some time before starting his own job consultancy services. Having failed to run the manpower consultancy, he used to gather details of job seekers from websites such as naukri.com and contact applicants over phone introducing himself as an HR manager of reputed IT companies. To win the confidence of the job seekers, he would organise telephonic interviews through his associates in the name of those companies and collect sums in the range of Rs.1.5 lakh to Rs.2 lakh from them. He would then send fake appointment letters to the candidates online. After receiving complaints from 18 persons who were duped, the CCS officials registered a cheating case and the CCS team led by Inspector P. Venkatagiri tracked his movements. The accused was caught while trying to trap more job seekers at Punjagutta.  OPEN",

The tragic death of Atul Loya, 16, first year Inter student of Narayana College in Vithalwadi in Himayathangar, right in front of the Narayanaguda police station, triggered tension with student unions and political parties staging protests. Atuls classmate, Govind Jaju, 16, who was riding pillion, escaped with minor injuries. Reckless act The two teenagers from Dilsukhnagar area started for college on their Honda Activa around 8.30 a.m. They were proceeding from Shanti theatre side to Narayanguda junction when home guard Krishna Goud, opened the left side door of the Rakshak vehicle. Policemen stopped the Rakshak vehicle on the road in front of the police station and were to alight to hand over some documents to the officials. The Home Guard apparently failed to notice the vehicles coming from the side and the vehicle door hit the scooter. Brought dead Atul Loya was thrown off his bike and fell on the left side and was run over by the bus. He was rushed to Apollo Hospital in Hyderguda in a three-wheeler with bleeding wounds where the doctors declared him brought dead. As news spread about the incident, hundreds of students from different colleges in the area gathered at the station and demanded action against the policemen. Compensation sought Meanwhile, activists of some students unions and political parties too descended there demanding compensation to the victims family, leading to tension.

        "content": " Senior police officers are unanimous in their opinion that had the basic principles of investigation been followed at the outset, the sensational Aarushi-Hemraj murder case could have been cracked. Soon after a crime is reported, securing the scene of occurrence is a must to ensure that material evidence is not disturbed or destroyed. Where a murder takes place in a house, it is mandatory and a common practice to first ascertain the possible entry and exit points used by the intruders. Had that been done in the Aarushi case, the second body (of Hemraj) that lay on the terrace would have been discovered immediately. Knowledge about the existence of second body inside the same premises could be of immense value in terms of further course of investigation, said an officer. Another golden rule is to initiate investigations into a crime from the scene of occurrence itself. The scene will not mislead, a suspect can. The evidence available on the spot can provide all necessary leads for probe into logical directions, leading to the perpetrators. Once you start investigations from suspects, there is always a chance of getting misled and by that time, crucial evidence is lost. It is a fatal error, said a senior police officer. Evidence -- which includes eyewitnesses, material evidence such as murder weapon, bloodstains, fingerprints and post-mortem findings, and circumstantial evidence -- is an essential part in all kinds of investigation. Even in cases where probe starts from suspects, evidence is a must to connect them to the crime. Investigations in the Aarushi case were botched up the moment the Noida police failed to properly secure and thoroughly survey the crime scene. There they committed the blunder. They instead went after the suspect, Hemraj, as Aarushi's parents reported him to be missing. Crucial time was lost and the scene of crime was not completely studied and left exposed, he said. Even while lifting the evidence, it is alleged that proper care was not taken. Most fingerprints lifted from the spot were of no consequence. It is alleged that some of the items that could have been examined were also not seized immediately. The vaginal swabs drawn from the girl's body were also contaminated. The mobile phone of the victim remained missing for a long time. The murder weapon(s) also could not be found, said another officer. Though the Noida police arrested Aarushi's father Rajesh Talwar, they did not have any evidence against him. In the absence of evidentiary facts, investigators tend to build theories and follow each of them and reach a conclusion by the method of elimination. Probably, this is what happened after the Central Bureau of Investigation took over the case. The investigators apparently started working on various theories, including the one as per which the murders were the handiwork of the Talwars' servant Krishna, the domestic help of their family friend Durranis, Rajkumar, and Vijay Mandal, domestic help of their neighbour. The CBI made the three suspects undergo all kinds of scientific tests, including brain-mapping and narco-analysis. However, none of them proved to be corroborative nor did they lead to any recovery of crucial evidence like the murder weapon. The theory fell flat. After a long gap the agency started probing Rajesh Talwar's suspected role, but again met a dead end. Even in cases where they are no direct proofs, circumstantial evidence may lead to the perpetrator and establish his/her complicity in the court. A plausible explanation for the absence of crucial direct evidence would strengthen the case further, said the officer, adding that a closure report is always filed with a rider that it can be opened anytime if any relevant and significant fact crops up in future.

Justice V. Periya Karuppiah ordered transfer of investigation following a criminal original petition filed by A. Saibunissa, maternal grandmother of the deceased children. She claimed that the Vadipatti police had not taken constructive steps to arrest three prime culprits who flew to Malaysia after murdering the trio due to previous enmity with her son-in-law. The petitioner's counsel Veera Kathiravan said that his client's daughter A. Adila Banu of Ramanathapuram district had married a ration shop employee Muthusamy. A Dalit by birth, he later converted to Islam and renamed himself as Ahamad. The couple had two children, a boy and a girl aged seven and five. A few years later, her son-in-law took up a job in Malaysia. After his departure, one of his former colleagues met the petitioner's daughter and grandchildren and took them in his car in the guise of getting them a free cooking gas cylinder. A day later, the petitioner lodged a complaint with the Kenikarai police station in Ramanathapuram regarding the missing trio. Two days thereafter, their bodies were found near Vadipatti in Madurai district. Investigations revealed that the murder had been committed at the behest of an individual who was inimical against Ahamad for turning out to be a hostile witness in the murder case of the former's brother-in-law. The police also found out that three main accused had fled to Malaysia immediately after executing the murder with the help of hooligans who disposed of the dead bodies in the culvert.   OPEN",

Addressing presspersons here on Friday, Janata Dal (Secular) Legislature Party leader H.D. Revanna and deputy leader Bandeppa Kashempur said the party would also stage a protest before the Rastrapathi Bhavan in New Delhi and submit a petition to the President to draw her attention to the rampant corruption and misuse of power by the Yeddyurappa Government. Congress MLAs and leaders would also participate in the agitation, Mr. Revanna said. They said the Janata Dal (Secular) MLAs would not participate in the next session of the State Legislative Assembly if Speaker K.G. Bopaiah did not reject the report submitted by Appachu Ranjan of the BJP recommending suspension of 15 Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) MLAs' membership. Terming the constitution of the panel headed by Mr. Ranjan as illegal, Mr. Kashempur said the panel had no powers to authorise the Speaker to suspend the MLAs. The Chief Minister used the Speaker to cover all scams by not allowing a debate on scams under the adjournment motion sought to be moved by the Opposition. Mr. Revanna said the Chief Minister had written letters to tashildars of all taluks of Hassan district seeking details on land owned by the family of the former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.

Rao said that the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act (popularly known as RTE Act) was brought into force across the country from April 1, 2010. The Karnataka Government promised to implement the Act in 2010-11. Minister for Primary Education Vishveshwar Hegde Kegeri recently said that the Act would be implemented from 2011-12 citing lack of funds. This has disappointed us and we feel that this Act would follow the fate of Child Labour Act. The Government's target to end the child labour was extended from 2007 to 2011 and now further extended to 2020, he said. Mr. Rao said educationists and organisations working for the welfare of children had given several suggestions to the Government for the effective implementation of the RTE Act. Perhaps, government is yielding to the pressure from the private schools management to postpone the implementation. Most of the private schools have already completed admission process expecting the introduction of the Act from this year, he said. The CACL sought cancellation of admission process of private schools to safeguard the interest of children.

Suresh Kumar directed the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to file an impleading application in the Supreme Court to cull the animals. Mumbai precedence The Mumbai City Corporation filed a writ petition before the Supreme Court in 2007 seeking relaxation of Prevention of Atrocities against Animals rules so that stray dogs may be culled. Chairing a meeting with the officials of the BBMP's Animal Husbandry Department, along with Commissioner Siddaiah, the Minister said that the tragedy is an eye-opener and steps must be taken to tackle the stray dog menace. We should not wait until another such incident. We must protect our children and elderly from this menace. It is inhuman if we don't act now. I will consult the Advocate-General regarding filing the impleading application in the Supreme Court, he said. Statistics sought Mr. Suresh Kumar told the officials to prepare a feasibility report on culling of strays, besides providing statistics on the number of dogs sterilised and euthanised. Leader of Opposition in the BBMP Council M. Nagaraj suggested that dog pounds on 20 to 30 acres of land be established on the city's outskirts and asked the officials to prepare a feasibility report. Senior councillors, including B.S. Sathyanarayana, B.R. Nanjundappa, B.V. Ganesh and B.S. Manjunath Reddy, claimed that the BBMP's Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme was ineffective and that sterilised dogs were just as ferocious as the others. Dog pounds Mr. Siddaiah said as a contingency measure, dog pounds could be established in all the eight zones of the city. Parvez Ahmed Piran, Joint Director (Animal Husbandry), opined that the BBMP required a joint strategy of culling and ABC programme. Currently, dogs could only be culled if they were ferocious, terminally ill/ injured or rabid. He said there were an estimated three lakh dogs (including pets) in the city. Deputy Mayor N. Dayanand and officials of the Animal Husbandry Department were present.   OPEN",

        "content": " The alleged links between the Trinamool Congress and the Maoists were reiterated at a Left Front rally in Lalgarh in Paschim Medinipur district of West Bengal on Friday. This is significant as it is the first public meeting held by the Left there since the area became an epicentre of Maoist activities and the Maoist-backed Police Santrash Birodhi Janasadharaner Committee (PSBJC) two years ago. Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee was unsuccessful in ousting the Communist Party of India (Marxist) from this region so she asked Maoist leader Kishenji to do this task for them, said Sushanta Ghosh, Minister of Paschimanchal Unnayan Affairs. Kishenji is now repeatedly saying that he wants to see Ms. Banerjee as the next Chief Minister, he added. Dipak Sarkar, secretary, District Committee of the CPI(M), attended the rally. The rally was held less than two months after a large number of CPI (M) supporters, evicted from their homes in the face of Maoist onslaught, returned. Bearing the party flag, an estimated 12,000 people marched from Dharampur to Lalgarh and reopened the CPI (M) local committee office there, closed since June 16, 2009. Commenting on the rally, Biman Bose, Chairman of the State Left Front Committee, told journalists that it was not fair to compare it with Trinamool's August 9 rally addressed by Ms. Banerjee. Asked about the controversy over the exchange of letters between Home Minister P. Chidambaram and West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Mr. Bose said that the language of Mr. Chidambaram's letter resembled that of the deputation submitted to him by the Trinamool. We are only asking Mr. Chidambaram not to act in a partisan manner.  OPEN",

The report mentions the name of Dr. Talwar as the only suspect, making it amply clear that he was under scrutiny for some reasons  one being that the two murders were in all probability committed by someone present in the house, which was not broken into by anyone on the fateful night. Secondly, it is learnt that the CBI found that the door to the terrace  where the body of Hemraj was discovered  never used to be locked earlier. No answers The agency could not get an answer to that from the Talwars. The investigators also suspect that attempts were made by a relative of the Talwars to influence the doctor who conducted the post-mortem on Aarushi's body. However, the CBI has not come across any substantial proof against Dr. Talwar to charge-sheet him in the case. On the other hand, the three other suspects, Dr. Talwar's servant Krishna, his family friend Durranis' domestic help Raj Kumar and Vijay Mandal, the domestic help of his neighbour, have virtually been given a clean chit as their alibis have been established as per the new findings. The three were earlier arrested by another CBI team that on the basis of alleged findings of scientific tests such as brain-mapping and narco-analysis had claimed that they had brutally murdered Aarushi and Hemraj. The suspicions reportedly raised by the CBI in its report have been rubbished by the Talwars. Aarushi's mother Nupur Talwar accused the CBI of doing a cover-up of the shoddy investigation conducted by the Uttar Pradesh police. Rajesh Talwar told NDTV: I have had enough of this. This is the second time I am going through this. This is what they do to innocent people, an innocent father who has lost his child. I cannot understand this kind of investigative agency. I have no words for them. Do they care about Aarushi? Do they care about my child? Aarushi is dead and gone, said Ms. Talwar, adding how can they make allegations without evidence? PTI reports: The dentist couple dismissed the CBI's allegations that they tried to influence the doctor who conducted the post-mortem, saying these were absolutely concocted. When asked that the records indicate that a call was made to the doctor conducting the post-mortem, Ms. Talwar said: What does indicate mean...They have call records. Either they know a call was made or they don't. You don't get indications where a call comes from. Mr. Rajesh Talwar said that he had extended all possible cooperation in the probe. I opened my mind to them. I underwent lie detector, brain mappingand what have they done? Ms. Talwar said: It is their job to get evidence. They don't find evidence, then how do they hurl allegations. On the question that Mr. Talwar was surfing the net at the time of murder, he said he had never denied that he was doing that. The couple demanded that the CBI conduct touch DNA to get evidence and constitute a fresh team of officers.  OPEN",

One day a Gopika comes to Yasoda with a complaint. Her daughter had been wearing a pretty pair of bangles. She had instructed her not to talk to Krishna. But when the mother was away, Krishna approached the girl and asked whether He could have a look at her bangles. The girl admiring Krishna' good looks, forgot her mother's warning and gave Krishna her bangles. Krishna promptly took the bangles and traded them for jamun fruits. But Yasoda, instead of punishing Krishna, says to the Gopika that she should not have left her daughter alone. Another Gopika comes with her complaint. She too knew that Krishna was out to steal butter. So she had asked her daughter to have no truck with Krishna. That morning, the Gopika had poured milk into a pot to boil it, but found that she had no embers to light a fire. So she decided to borrow some embers from her neighbour. But she could not leave the milk unguarded, for fear that Krishna would come and drink it up. So she left her daughter in charge, with the warning that Krishna, seeing her leave, might come to the house and try to steal the milk, and that the girl should, therefore, be careful. The girl assured her mother that she would be careful. But what was supposed to be a quick, purposeful visit turned into a bit extended, for the woman stayed awhile in her neighbour's house, indulging in idle gossip. This was the opportunity Krishna was waiting for. He sneaked into the house and struck up a conversation with the girl. Forgetting her mother's words, the girl told Krishna that her mother was at her neighbour's place. Krishna wondered what was keeping the girl's mother so long, and He asked her to go and see what the matter was. And while the girl was away, He drank all the milk. And yet Yasoda doesn't get angry with her son, for even His lies are endearing!  OPEN",

The body of 20-year-old Roshan Mandal, a migrant worker from Pirpainthi village in Bhagalpur district in Bihar, was recovered past 2 a.m. from the open well near a construction site. He was declared dead on arrival at the Howrah State General Hospital and the body was sent for an autopsy later in the day, police sources said. The post mortem however has revealed that death was caused by a severe injury to the head and was likely to have been instantaneous, police sources added. We have arrested Birendra Yadav, the owner of the building where the construction was taking place, who has been charged with section 304A of the Indian Penal Code (Causing death by negligence), said Officer-in-Charge of Liluah Police Station Bikram Thapa . A day after the incident, the well has been boarded up and a police contingent posted at the construction site where an eerie calm prevails. Knowing that there will be no work at the site for a few days, the construction workers did not report for duty. The large crowds that had gathered during the course of the rescue operations have left, but a few curious youth returned for a second look. The police, the firemen and the Disaster Management Group took so long in conducting the rescue. If the victim had been a local, there would surely have been a huge outrage, said Sheik Shah Alam, who had watched the operations all through the night. But the villagers nearby knew little about Roshan Mandal, who had come to the State three years ago, brought here by Mr. Yadav, who is related to him. He would fetch and carry food and other odd items for Mr. Yadav and stayed in his house in Howrah. On the fateful day, he had taken Mr. Yadavs lunch to the construction site and fell into the well when asked to draw water from it. My son was forced to leave school when he was in Class IV. His elder brother is in the Army and his younger brother is still in school. I had sent him to stay here, said Bhupender Mandal, Roshans father who rushed here on hearing the news.

Emergency medical service 108 was called and the girl, who was unconscious then, was rushed to the civil hospital where she was declared brought dead.

Chidambaram's controversial letter to West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had another ramification when work was disrupted at the General Post Office (GPO) here on Friday in the morning hours when two unions went on strike, after some disciplinary action against employees by the authorities. Some employees of the delivery department of the Kolkata GPO were show-caused on Friday over the delay in the delivery of the letter which was sent from Mr. Chidambaram's office in New Delhi by Speed Post on December 22, 2010, but reached Mr. Bhattacharjee's office only on December 27. In a separate development, two members of the clerical staff of the Kolkata GPO were transferred on Thursday as part of a disciplinary measure against them. Protesting this action, two apolitical unions affiliated to the National Federation of Postal Employees went on strike. The strike is in no way connected to the controversy over the letter. It was called off after a meeting with the leaders, said S. K. Chakrabarti, Chief Post Master General (CPMG), West Bengal circle, who refused to comment on the disciplinary action taken against the employees. Work was suspended at the GPO in the morning hours when disciplinary action was initiated against two employees, but after meeting with the CPMG, we called off the strike and work has resumed, said Janardan Majumdar, the State secretary of the All India Postal Employees Union (Group C). Long drawn-out stir Mr. Majumdar explained that the action initiated against the employees on Thursday was a part of a long drawn-out agitation that began in September by the unions and that the two issues (transfer and show-cause) should not be confused. Earlier, four employees had been suspended, but as a result of the sustained agitation the order was revoked, he added.   OPEN",

The mosque was demolished on Wednesday on the direction of acourt on a contempt of court petition filed by the Jungpura Residents' Welfare Association against the DDA for not complying with an earlier order of the court to demolish the mosque. In the compliance report filed by one of its officials, the DDA submitted that it had not violated the demolition order. However, if any act of omission and commission on its part was construed as any infraction of the judgment, the DDA tendered an unqualified apology and prayed forgiveness, the report said. Noor Masjid's boundary wall and newly-constructed tin shed were removed and thereafter the land measuring 350 sq metres was reclaimed, the report said. The report further said that fencing of the land and construction of a new boundary wall was in progress, and a sign board had been put up at the site reading DDA Land. The DDA urged the Court to dismiss the contempt petition in view of the demolition of the illegal mosque. Meanwhile, the Delhi Wakf Board filed and later withdrew a petition seeking modification of the demolition order, when a Division Bench of the Court comprising Justice Dipak Misra and Sanjeev Khanna said this court did not have the authority to hear the petition filed under the Delhi Wakf Act. The Bench suggested to the Board to approach the Wakf Tribunal instead. The Board in its petition said that before a mosque was built on the site, it was a burial ground for Muslims. It said that it its land and hence DDA should have approached it before demolishing the mosque. Petition withdrawn However, the petition was withdrawn when the Bench said that if something was found contrary to the facts brought before it during arguments, the Court would impose a penalty of Rs.1 lakh on the Board.

        "content": " : Functioning of share-autorickshaws and mini-buses would be streamlined soon in the city, said Commissioner of Police P. Balasubramanian here on Friday. Speaking to reporters, he said that more than maintenance of law and order and crime prevention, handling traffic posed a challenge to the police. While the roads remained the same, the number of vehicles had raised manifold. Despite limitations, the police provided space in the existing roads for all vehicles by making some changes here and there. We have given relief to vehicle flow around Periyar bus stand by effecting minor alterations. Public are welcome to offer suggestions for improvement and decongestion, he added. The police had improved its performance in maintenance of law and order and also in recovery of stolen goods in 2010, when compared with previous two years. Commending the special teams, Mr. Balsubramanian said that murder cases had fallen from 37 (in 2009) to 31 (in 2010). The grave cases of murder were more due to domestic problems than other kinds, he replied to a query. Detaining habitual offenders under the Goondas Act too had risen from 100 to 121 in 2010. Police would not remain mute spectators to anti-social elements who indulged in threats that posed problems to the public. But for one unsolved case of 109 sovereigns of gold missing from a locked home in a row-type house in Narayanapuram, New Natham Road reported a couple of months ago, the police had detected 82 per cent of crimes in 2010 and handed over the properties to the owners. In fact, in the murder of a pawn broker Manickam Chettiar near Netaji Road, financier Ponmurugan in TPK Road and a house wife Kayalvizhi in S. S. Colony limits, the police swiftly solved and recovered all valuables, including the gold intact from the accused. The traffic police had collected Rs 1.76 crore fines from 1.75 lakh cases registered for various violations, which was higher by Rs 5.87 lakh than 2009. This showed the strict enforcement on erring vehicle users. The fund for construction of new office of the Commissioner of Police is awaiting financial sanction from the State government. Mr. Balasubramanian also hoped to get a permanent strength of 238 police personnel for the Meenakshi Temple. Though 117 people had died in road accidents in 2010, the rate has been falling since the last two years; he said and added that it was 142 deaths in 2008 and 125 in 2009. With motorists' support, we hope to strive hard by bringing down the number further down. Deputy Commissioners of Police J. Rajendran and R. Chinnaswamy, ACPs and Inspectors were present on the occasion.  OPEN",

The meticulous checks by the BDDS team yielded nothing with the threat call only turning out to be a hoax. Days before this incident, similar checks were conducted for nearly three hours  this time at the Tiruchi Railway Junction in the late hours jointly by the anti-sabotage teams of the city police and the Railway Protection Force following an anonymous call. That too turned out to be a hoax. In a state of readiness round-the-clock, the BDDS team has sprung into action every time such threat calls were brought to its notice in the recent past. Over the last 14 months, law enforcers had received 19 anonymous calls within the city limits with all of them turning out to be hoax. No prankster has been arrested in connection with the anonymous threat calls made in the recent past for want of evidence, admit law enforcers. The anonymous call barely lasts a few seconds, but the follow up action launched by the anti-sabotage team goes on for a longer duration as they it will not vacate unless fully convinced that there was no explosive substance anywhere in that spot or in its vicinity, say police sources.Anonymous it may be, but we treat every threat call as a live bomb call, says a senior city police officer. The fire service and ambulance service are alerted immediately upon receipt of the threat call and the place or building where the explosive substance is said to have been planted would be kept out of bounds of the public to enable the anti-sabotage team to carry out its search, says the officer. Power is turned off as a safety measure and people evacuated from the building before launching the bomb checking operation. The specific task that every team member needs to carry out is decided while heading towards the spot in the vehicle and the action plan drawn up before arriving at the spot. The services of a nodal officer who is aware of the finer details of the building or the place, where the mission is to be carried out, are utilised, the officer says. The duration of the checks depends on the area to be covered. Some checks last 30 minutes, but some take two hours and more. The team will not move out without becoming fully satisfied that there is no explosive substance in that spot or in its vicinity, the officer said.  R.

        "content": " The Supreme Court faced a stiff challenge in 2010 in dealing with allegations of corruption against judges of the higher judiciary. It took a bold decision not to elevate the then Karnataka High Court Chief Justice, P.D. Dinakaran (who is at present Chief Justice of Sikkim High Court), as a judge of the Supreme Court following a controversy over alleged land grab. Even as Justice Dinakaran was shifted out of the Karnataka High Court, Parliament initiated removal proceedings against him in respect of certain allegations and the probe is pending before a committee headed by Justice Aftab Alam, Judge of the Supreme Court, who succeeded Justice V.S. Sirpurkar, who resigned. The second removal proceedings against a judge ended with a panel headed by Justice B. Sudershan Reddy, Supreme Court Judge, recommending removal of Justice Soumitra Sen, Judge of the Calcutta High Court, for proven misconduct. In a big relief to the Tamil Nadu government, the court granted protection for the continuance, for one more year, of the law that provides the Backward Classes, the Most Backward Classes and the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes 69 per cent reservation in jobs and education. It asked the State Backward Classes Commission to revisit the reservation issue on the basis of the quantifiable data in respect of the communities in question. If the Commission wanted to exceed the 50 per cent ceiling while re-fixing the quota, it could take into consideration the parameters laid down by the Supreme Court in the Mandal case judgment: compelling circumstances based on local conditions. To deal with the problem of foodgrains rotting in godowns, the Court asked the Centre to consider distributing them at very low cost or no cost as a short-term measure. When Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar confronted the court by saying that no order was passed but only a suggestion was made, the court again reiterated that is its direction on supply of rotting foodgrains was only an order and not a suggestion. The court referred to media reports on Mr. Pawar's statement and said, It was not a suggestion. It is there in our order. Efforts of the former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa, to get the disproportionate case against her and four others pending in a Bangalore court stayed on two occasions during the year did not fructify as the court was firm that the trial must proceed. However, the Supreme Court permitted the trial court to appoint an expert translator to assist in the trial. The court agreed to reopen the Bhopal gas tragedy case by admitting a curative petition filed by the Centre for restoration of the stringent charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which attracts the maximum punishment of 10-year jail term, against the accused. A trial court in Bhopal had convicted the accused to undergo two-year imprisonment. Subsequently, coinciding with the anniversary of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy, the Centre filed a curative petition seeking enhancement of the compensation of $470 million determined by the Supreme Court in 1989 on the ground that this settlement was arrived at on the basis of assumptions of truth unrelated to realities. Both the matters are still pending. While determining the question as to which parent the care and control of a child should be given, the paramount consideration remains the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under the statute, the court said. In a big relief to the Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh, the Court held that the Noida park area would not come under the ambit of forest' and hence permitted the erection of statues and other structures in the park. The court decided to examine industrialist Ratan Tata's petition, which alleged that the publication of the tapes of his private conversations with corporate lobbyist Niira Radia had infringed his right to privacy. Mr. Tata has raised an important question relating to the interpretation of the Article 21 of the Constitution concerning right to life, which also includes the right to privacy. The court came to the rescue of the press and whistle-blowers when it said, If a speech or article, editorial contains something which appears to be contemptuous and this Court or the High Court is called upon to initiate proceedings under the Contempt of Court Act, the truth should ordinarily be allowed as a defence unless the court finds that it is only a camouflage to escape the consequences of deliberate or malicious attempt to scandalise the court or is an interference with the administration of justice. It also decided to examine, by a Constitution Bench, the conflict between the right of citizens to obtain information under the Right to Information (RTI) Act and the right to immunity enjoyed by the judiciary not to disclose information pertaining to appointment of judges. In the Sethusamudram case, the court ruled out giving any direction relating to the project or vacating the stay on the project till the final report of the expert committee examining the feasibility of carrying it through Dhanuskodi instead of Rama Setu, submitted its report in February 2011. On the whole, the Supreme Court stood up to the expectations and reaffirmed the faith people continued to have in the judiciary when other institutions fail to perform their duty satisfactorily.

        "content": " The closure report filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the sensational Aarushi Talwar-Hemraj murder case has raised doubts about the conduct of the young girl's father, Rajesh Talwar, as he was allegedly unable to explain certain circumstances. The report mentions the name of Dr. Talwar as the only suspect, making it amply clear that he was under scrutiny for some reasons  one being that the two murders were in all probability committed by someone present in the house, which was not broken into by anyone on the fateful night. Secondly, it is learnt that the CBI found that the door to the terrace  where the body of Hemraj was discovered  never used to be locked earlier. The agency could not get an answer to that from the Talwars. The investigators also suspect that attempts were made by a relative of the Talwars to influence the doctor who conducted the post-mortem on Aarushi's body. However, the CBI has not come across any substantial proof against Dr. Talwar to charge-sheet him in the case. On the other hand, the three other suspects, Dr. Talwar's servant Krishna, his family friend Durranis' domestic help Raj Kumar and Vijay Mandal, the domestic help of his neighbour, have virtually been given a clean chit as their alibis have been established as per the new findings. The three were earlier arrested by another CBI team that on the basis of alleged findings of scientific tests such as brain-mapping and narco-analysis had claimed that they had brutally murdered Aarushi and Hemraj. The suspicions reportedly raised by the CBI in its report have been rubbished by the Talwars. Aarushi's mother Nupur Talwar accused the CBI of doing a cover-up of the shoddy investigation conducted by the Uttar Pradesh police. Rajesh Talwar told NDTV: I have had enough of this. This is the second time I am going through this. This is what they do to innocent people, an innocent father who has lost his child. I cannot understand this kind of investigative agency. I have no words for them. Do they care about Aarushi? Do they care about my child? Aarushi is dead and gone, said Ms. Talwar, adding how can they make allegations without evidence? PTI reports: The dentist couple dismissed the CBI's allegations that they tried to influence the doctor who conducted the post-mortem, saying these were absolutely concocted. When asked that the records indicate that a call was made to the doctor conducting the post-mortem, Ms. Talwar said: What does indicate mean...They have call records. Either they know a call was made or they don't. You don't get indications where a call comes from. Mr. Rajesh Talwar said that he had extended all possible cooperation in the probe. I opened my mind to them. I underwent lie detector, brain mappingand what have they done? Ms. Talwar said: It is their job to get evidence. They don't find evidence, then how do they hurl allegations. On the question that Mr. Talwar was surfing the net at the time of murder, he said he had never denied that he was doing that. The couple demanded that the CBI conduct touch DNA to get evidence and constitute a fresh team of officers. No substantial proof against him'   Three others given a clean chit  OPEN",

The report also held guilty Verma and his elder son Mukesh for not taking the victim to hospital in time following which the girl died. A charge-sheet will be filed in the case soon, the CB-CID officials said. Fourteen DNA samples were taken in the case. These included samples of Chanderpal Verma, Mukesh, Piyush, Munna and some school teachers and students, CB-CID ASP D.P. Srivastav and Investigation Officer Arun Kumar said over phone. The samples were sent for testing at forensic laboratory in Lucknow and Hyderabad, they said. According to preliminary investigations, the CB-CID team found that the 70-year-old school manager was at his home while his elder son was in Unnao. Piyush was, however, near the school premises, they said. Later call details of Piyush's mobile phone also hinted of his involvement in the case, they said. Piyush, who is the prime accused will be booked under IPC 377 (unnatural offences) in the charge-sheet to be filed by the team on January 3, they said. Meanwhile, Kanpur DIG Ashok Mutha Jain said since the matter was being probed by CB-CID, the team will submit its report to officials in Lucknow and thereafter also any investigation will be carried out by them only. On September 27, a 12-year-old student was allegedly sexually assaulted at Bharatiya Gyan Sthali School. The girl was sent back home along with two maids and her mother was informed at her workplace. The girl was admitted to a hospital where she died the same day. - PTI  OPEN",

Mammen, who is Chairman and Managing Director of MRF; Arun Mammen, Managing Director of MRF; and daughter Ramani Joseph. In 1990 she had lost her son Ravi Mammen, who was Managing Director of MRF. The burial took place after a church service at Kilpauk cemetery on Sunday evening. Kunjamma was involved in a variety of social, religious, charitable and philanthropic activities over the years but chose to keep a low profile and largely stayed by the side of her husband, whom she lost in 2003. Their Chennai home hosted many a memorable social gathering in their time. A leading industrialist who spoke to The Hindu recalled the warmth with which the couple greeted and hosted guests on such occasions. She was an enthusiastic member of the choir of the Orthodox Syrian Church in Chennai where she consistently sought to encourage youngsters to come to the fore. She was a source of strength whenher husband, a member of the Kandathil family in Kerala, started the Madras Rubber Factory out of a shed in Tiruvottiyur in the 1950s, an enterprise that grew from a toy-making unit to a globally-competitive tyre manufacturer. Often he would, only half in jest, describe his wife as the first employee of MRF. Apart from helping her husband in building the company, she took active part in corporate events and social gatherings. She must have had a sharp memory as she addressed many old-timers in the organisation by their first names, an employee said. When the occasion demanded it, she accompanied her husband on visit to employees houses  a practice she continued even after his death.

Addressing his party leaders and workers soon after assuming charge of his new post at the partys State headquarters here, Mr. Singh Deo expressed the hope that the truth would come to light once the M.B. Shah Commission submitted its final report on its probe into the mining scam to the Centre. The BJP further alleged that Mr. Patnaik was also involved in the matter pertaining to the signing of an agreement between Delhi-based Sainik Mining and Odisha Mining Corporation. The agreement had since been cancelled. Mr. Singh Deo also went on to say that Mr. Patnaik would meet the same fate as former Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda. Earlier, Mr. Singh Deo also told presspersons that the BJP would not have any sort of alliance with the ruling Biju Janata Dal or the Odisha Jan Morcha in the 2014 polls. The party, he said, would go to the people and focus on major issues by involving party leaders and workers at the grassroots level. The BJP leader, who was given a rousing welcome as he arrived at the Biju Patnaik airport in the afternoon coming from New Delhi, was brought to the party office in a procession. All top leaders of the party in the State, including his predecessor and former Union Minister Jual Oram were present at the meeting held at the party office. Several leaders who also addressed the meeting expressed confidence that the party would perform well in the coming polls under Mr. Singh Deos leadership. The truth will come to light once the M.B.

President Pratibha Devisingh Patil will present the medal at the start of the Republic Day parade here on Wednesday, a Defence Ministry release said here. His name was recommended for the award on August 15 last. The Manipur-born late Major is survived by his parents, who live in their native place in Bishnupur, in West Bengal. The incident occurred on February 26 when a suicide bomber triggered a blast, killing three guards in a guarded residential compound of the Indian embassy in Kabul. Six Army medical officers, four paramedics and two Army officers of Education corps had been present. Major Singh had assailed the armed terrorist, pinning him down, and lost his life when the bomber blew himself up. His act of exemplary courage, grit, selflessness and valour in the face of a terrorist attack saved his colleagues. On the eve of Republic Day, the President approved 440 gallantry and other defence decorations to armed forces personnel. These include 5 Kirti Chakra, 21 Shaurya Chakra, 5 Bar to Sena Medal (Gallantry), 135 Sena Medal (Gallantry), 2 Nao Sena Medal (Gallantry), 3 Vayu Sena Medal (Gallantry), 28 Param Vishisht Seva Medal, 4 Uttam Yudh Seva Medal, 51 Ati Vishisht Seva Medal, 4 Yudh Seva Medal, 2 Bar to Sena Medal (Devotion to Duty), 38 Sena Medal (Devotion to Duty), 8 Nao Sena Medal (Devotion to Duty), 14 Vayu Sena Medal (Devotion to Duty), 2 Bar to Vishisht Seva Medal and 118 Vishisht Seva Medal.

        "content": " Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is making full-fledged attempts to infiltrate Indias strategic organisations by spoofing telephone calls and using malware to snoop into crucial websites and systems. Sounding an alert regarding such espionage attempts from across the border, the Intelligence Bureau has warned that Pakistans intelligence operatives (PIOs) were targeting defence forces headquarters and other strategic organisations to collect sensitive information. PIOs are frequently targeting government personnel/officers to collect sensitive information through spoofed VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calls prefixed with the STD code of Delhi The PIOs have been using the stratagem of calling phone numbers of security forces posing as officers belonging to Army/Navy/Air Force HQ (headquarters) and collecting details about the deployment, movement and other information about security forces, says an internal note of the IB. The ISI operatives are also targeting Indian Railways, banks, and serving/retired employees and civil contractors working for Military Engineering Services (MES) to collect sensitive and defence-related information. They (PIOs) have also been making telephone calls under assumed identities by using spoofed numbers to various CPMFs (central paramilitary forces), railways, banks etc, the note says. They (PIOs) have succeeded in ferreting out sensitive information from the persons attending these calls. IB has been regular in highlighting the stratagem of PIOs using fake identities, the note adds. The IB has now asked the Department of Telecom to constitute a high-level technical committee to examine the issue of spoofed calls and find possible solutions that could be implemented in a time-bound manner. Explaining how the ISI has managed to infiltrate Indias communication networks, the IB note adds: Using VoIP and computer software to mask the point of origin of their calls, Pakistans intelligence operatives have been noticed to be masquerading as senior Indian armed forces officers to contact their targets on the telephone to collect such information. The modus operandi involves the use of software by PIOs operating from Pakistan to ensure that the mobile phone of the target displays the incoming call to be originating from a spoofed Indian number. Though these VoIP calls originate outside India, they reflect an Indian-specific CLI (caller line identification). Referring to a recent incident of espionage, the IB note points out that, in February this year, it had sounded an alert regarding possible contamination of BSNL systems by the ISI. This stratagem now appears to have been successfully used by them for a cyber offensive against the subscriber database and communication links of BSNL, it adds. In the incident, an ISI operative posing as a Major posted in the Army headquarters in Delhi contacted a BSNL employee and persuaded him to not only give details of technical persons involved in the crucial call data record project but also forwarded some emails, thus compromising the system. As a result, the ISI was able to successfully install some malware in the BSNL system, thus contaminating the computer systems and compromising the integrity and security of the system. The malware planted by the PIO might also be used by the ISI in identifying and accessing communication links of other sensitive organisations, marking them vulnerable to cyber attacks, including remote monitoring operations and disabling of critical networks, it adds. It is worth mentioning that the BSNL is a major agency that is implementing important projects related to critical infrastructure protection, counter-terrorism and cyber security, which includes the Centralised Monitoring System (CMS) and the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System (CCTNS). In another incident that occurred just after the Hyderabad twin blasts in February 2013, the entire intelligence fraternity went into a tizzy following reports that a suspected ISI agent had infiltrated the elite National Security Guard (NSG) by calling up one of its officers and managing to get some details of investigations into the case. Though the NSG claimed that its officer, a Major on deputation from the Army, did not share any crucial information with the ISI agent, who had called the EPBX system at NSGs headquarters here, a high-level inquiry was ordered into the incident.
