People congregated at the station around 4 p.m. and posters were displayed in the town. The train was decorated with balloons and garlands. The station wore a festive look and people distributed sweets and toffees. Visitors outnumbered passengers at the station. Bodi MLA S. Lakshmanan and Judicial Magistrate Mahaboor Ali Khan flagged off the train. Passengers knew well that it was not an adieu but only an au revoir.   OPEN",

The State government revised its initial strategy of having outreach coverage soon after deaths were reported following measles immunisation in April 2008. From a system in which VHNs took vaccines to the health sub centres (HSC), the State decided to move to an arrangement under which all vaccines under the Universal Immunisation Programme would be administered only by doctors in Primary Health Centres (PHCs). This shift was agreed upon to ensure that the vaccine is administered safely, and in case of emergencies, the child be treated immediately, Principal Secretary, Health, V.K.Subburaj, told The Hindu. Safety is the strength of the institutional immunisation programme, he added. However, there were objections from various groups of people including doctors' bodies that this had resulted in lowering the immunisation coverage.   OPEN",

Mallikarjun Kharge has said that he is confident that the Bill to amend Article 371 for grant of special status to the Hyderabad Karnataka region eill be passed during the ongoing session of Parliament, either on December 17 or 18. But for objections, which were unwarranted, raised by the State government, the Bill would have been passed by now. All-out efforts have been made to clear doubts and impediments, and the Bill will be tabled in the Lok Sabha in its original form and passed, Mr. Kharge said, while responding to presspersons here on Saturday. Mr. Kharge said that he had already spoken to chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance Sonia Gandhi and Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde about the need to accord priority for tabling the Bill and their responses were favourable. He said that he had also requested Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj, M. Venkaiah Naidu of the BJP and leaders of the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Samajwadi Party and the Left parties, among others, to support the Bill and they had agreed. I hope that the Bill will be passed on Monday or Tuesday, and if it does not happen for some technical reason, it will be definitely passed in the Budget session, he said. To a question, Mr. Kharge said that the proposed Bill, known as Article 371 (J), had been drafted with emphasis on education, employment and development. We have taken all positive aspects of the benefits of special status already extended to the Telangana, Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. This will help in the overall development of all the six districts in the Hyderabad Karnataka region, he said. He said that the most important advantage of the proposed Bill was that it would enable the State government to fix a quota in reservation for the Hyderabad Karnataka region in recruitment of Class I and Class II officers right from the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) and universities and lower down the order, besides education, State-level competitive examinations and the like. Secondly, the Governor would be vested with the task of ensuring that the special funds/grants earmarked for development of the region would not lapse. The reservation to be provided will have constitutional validity and will ensure that the purpose is served, he said. To another question, Mr. Kharge said that it would be wrong to freeze the process of filling vacant posts in various departments in anticipation of the passing of the Bill. According to him, it may take some time before the actual benefits of the special status starts percolating as many procedures had to be followed. It included drafting of rules and regulations and getting statutory approval and clearances. But posts could not be left vacant till that time, he said.

Mani, Minister for Law and Finance, has said. Mr Mani was addressing a Meet-the-Press programme at the Pathanamthitta Press Club on Saturday afternoon. Mr Mani said the health condition of Maudany, one of the 31 accused in the 2008 Bangalore serial blast case, was stated to be serious. According to Mr Mani, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy had already said the State government would send a delegation to Karnataka to enquire about the health condition of Maudany in the jail. Retirement age The Finance Minister said raising the retirement age of government employees was not in the governments agenda or under its consideration. He said the State Entrepreneur Development Mission (SEDM) was fast picking up. It was announced in the Budget for the current financial year and was aimed at providing self-employment training to 50,000 people in the next five years. The Mission could generate at least six lakh employment opportunities. Mr Mani said 845 people had availed themselves of training and 337 industrial units had already been launched as part of the mission. Forty units had already started production, amply indicting its public acceptance. Lottery The Finance Minister said the government could successfully salvage Kerala from the plunder of the lottery lobby from outside the State. The revenue of the Lottery Department had gone up to Rs.1,780 crore now from Rs.700 during the previous Left Democratic Front rule. A total of 63 draws had been made under the Karunya lottery scheme, facilitating medical treatment worth Rs.56 crore to 5,404 patients as on Saturday, he said. Price rise Mr Mani said the State government had taken steps to check the price rise of various essential commodities through the Consumerfed and Supplyco. The schemes to provide a maximum of 9-kg quality rice at a highly subsidised rate of one rupee a kg to the BPL category and Rs.2 a kg for the APL category was a right and revolutionary step to curb price rise, he added.

Besides, Health and Family Welfare Department had sought empanelled doctors list to speed up the appointment process, Dr. Prusty said. Last recruitment of doctors did not yield desired result. Only one third of total doctors are on duty while majority have either gone for higher study or remained absent unauthorisedly, he said. The DHS hinted that the State government would be taking stern action against errant doctors by dismissing from their job.

The government had taken departmental disciplinary action against 77 doctors. Southern districts have suffered most due to doctors unauthorised absence.

        "content": " A four-day workshop on contemporary dance that was organised by the Chavara Cultural Centre in Kozhikode was a novel experience to the city's dance enthusiasts who haven't had much exposure to the art form. Around 20 young dancers took part in the workshop held at Chavara Hall from December 27 to 30. Facilitated by internationally-trained dancer Rakesh M.P.S., the workshop was organised to give the participants a taste of contemporary dance, which is different from all classical dance forms and the Bollywood-style dance that has become quite a rage among youngsters these days. On the last day of the workshop, the participants performed for a select audience what they had learned at there. Mr. Rakesh, who has more than ten years of experience as a performer and a trainer in India and abroad, told The Hindu that contemporary dance was all about educating the body to speak a different language. Physical fitness and training in some sort of movement are important for anyone to practise contemporary dance. Hence, most contemporary dancers might have trained in either a classical dance form or a martial art form, or both. It is its immense freedom of movement and lack of rigid rules that attract most people to this comparatively new form of dance, which is loosely based on a number of internationally practised movement techniques, he said. Contemporary dance is based on the principle of moving without hurting another soul, or even the floor, quite unlike the other dance forms where footwork is very important. Even music is optional in this dance form. Silence sometimes makes the best music, Mr. Rakesh said. A stage was not necessary as the form was beyond space, he added. Mr. Rakesh, hailing from Kozhikode, practised Bollywood-style dance during his student days in Kozhikode and Chennai. Later, he joined the Attakkalari Centre for Movement Arts in Bangalore and then moved on to Bangalore Dance Collective. He has worked with several European choreographers and has completed many national and international projects as a freelance performer-trainer. He said his students at the workshop were extremely talented and flexibility was not a hurdle for them as most of them had experience in some sort of movement arts. In the workshop, they were given a basic idea on internationally-practised movement techniques, safe dance practise, enhancing performance abilities, improvisation, integration of different dance styles and creative movement composition. They were fast learners and gave a stunning presentation at the end of the workshop, he said. The workshop was a first of its kind in Kozhikode. Aabha Anoop  OPEN",

        "content": " : Education Minister M.A. Baby said here on Friday that writer and cartoonist O.V. Vijayan enriched Malayalam literature and took it to the international level with his epics like Khasakinte Ithihasam' (The Legend of Khasak) that depicted the rural and rustic life of Thassarak village in Palakkad. The Minister was speaking after inaugurating the O.V. Vijayan Cultural Centre and the Village Tourism project of the District Tourism Promotion Council at Thassarak. Mr. Baby said: We have to learn from the past to move forward and writers have a key role in it. We remember great writers more than Kings and Emperors, as literary works remained for generations in the minds of the people. For example, Prof. Joseph Mundassery is known for his literary work more than as Education Minister who had brought basic changes in the education sector in Kerala, Mr. Baby said. He said the biggest problem Malayalam language now faced was the attitude of the people towards teaching children their mother tongue. Most parents send their children to English medium schools. This will affect Malayalam literature and language adversely. This is because though we are literate, we have become culturally illiterate, the Minister said. In her presidential address, P. Valsala, writer and president of Kerala Sahitya Akademi, said there was no other epic novel in Malayalam as Khasakinte Ithihasam. Though it is a small novel in size, it was written in such a big canvass reflecting the rustic rural lives of a village of Palakkad. It must have been the environment and rural setting that attracted Vijayan to this typical village. His characters still live in Thassarak. So this work has become a big heritage for Malayalam literature, she said. In his keynote address, Sukumar Azhikode, writer and critic, said three great writers  Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, Madhavikutty and O.V. Vijayan  took Malayalam literature to new heights through their works. A photo and cartoon exhibition organised on O.V. Vijayan and his works as part of the programme was inaugurated by Ms. Valsala. K.K. Divakaran, MLA; Purushan Kadalundi, Secretary, Kerala Sahitya AKademi; writers O.V. Usha, Asha Menon, Vaishakhan, Mundur Sethumadhavan, M.K. Harikumar, among others, spoke. Poor local participation Local participation at the memorial meeting was lacking as most of them boycotted the function to protest against the organisers not inviting the panchayat ward member from the area to the function. Though it was a government function, the organisers allegedly did not invite Janaki, the ward member belonging to the Congress. This is the first time that the Congress won the ward defeating the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Congress workers in the area said CPI(M) panchayat president V. Sashidharan and members from the adjoining wards belonging to that party were invited but not the member representing the ward that included Thassarak. They said the boycott was to protest against the political discrimination shown by the organisers to the ward representative. It was not to show any disrespect to the great writer O.V. Vijayan, who based his novel Khasakhinte Ithihasam picking some of the characters who lived at Thassarak, they said.  OPEN",

There was heavy rush of pilgrims to the hill temple since morning. Pilgrims had to wait for hours inside the thickly packed barricades leading to the holy 18-steps (pathinettampady') for darshan of the deity. Security tightened The police tightened security arrangements at the pilgrim centre by deploying additional force in vulnerable areas. The rush was regulated by periodically blocking the pilgrims at Pampa. The downpour on Friday afternoon caused difficulties to pilgrims undertaking the trek. However, thousands trekked the holy hills braving the downpour that began at 3 p.m. K.S.

        "content": " The picturesque and calm waterway that links Marine Drive in the western end of the city with Kadambrayar on the east will soon come alive with the purring sound of tourist boats. A trial run was conducted recently. If passenger ferries start regular service, the waterway could decongest the narrow road from the city to Pallikkara. All that needs to be done is to dredge some shallow portions, remove water hyacinth from a few places along the currently underused waterway, and introduce faster boats. A tour by ferry is a refreshing experience, what with plenty of fresh air and cool breeze. Aimed at promoting the waterway and developing a tourism hub around Kadambrayar, the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) has selected the place as one among the four locales for Utsavam', which showcases Kerala's ethnic art forms. The other locales are Vasco Da Gama Square in Fort Kochi, the Kumbhalanghi Model Tourism Village, the Bolghatty Palace Hotel and Cherai, Kuzhipilly and Munambam beaches, where the programmes would be staged every Sunday, up to March 6. A seafood-speciality restaurant has been set up near the banks of the starting point of Kadambrayar, where around many streams join together to form the river. A fleet of boats of various sizes have been readied to ferry tourists to Kakkanad, Thevara, Marine Drive and back. Coconut palms line the kerb of the stone bunds that have been constructed on either side of the water body by the government to prevent encroachments and soil erosion. The project to extend a walkway from the locale to the State highway near Pallikara, is awaiting nod from local bodies. Thus, people would soon be able to walk up to the tourist locale from Pallikkara, said the DTPC secretary K. S. Shine, who is also the CEO of the Kadambrayar Destination Management Committee (DMC). The three-metre wide walkway would be 850-metres-long. Aimed at facilitating regular boat trips, the DMC's office would come up on the northern side of KSINC (KINCO) Boat Jetty near the High Court of Kerala. While the DTPC readied the basic infrastructure for the project, the DMC pooled in with the rest. We took the initiative in clearing water hyacinth from a good portion of the waterway. Guests can even engage in angling at the locale, said Baby John, who has leased out the restaurant and boat club from the DMC. John L. Paul  OPEN",

        "content": " Attractive lighting systems bring out the beauty of a building. If placed at the perfect spots at the correct angle, decorative and designer lights enhance the appeal of the rooms or the garden. Appropriate lighting also reduces power consumption, helping to keep a leash on the home budget. The conventional incandescent lights seem to be on the way out and a whole new range of lighting systems are replacing them. Compact fluorescent lamps have emerged as a major player in the luminaire market. With the rising concern for the environment, solar lighting systems are being encouraged by government agencies, but the high initial costs are preventing most people from installing the photovoltaic devices. The light emitting diodes (LEDs) have become a trendsetting lighting source worldwide. They are taking centre stage in the lighting scene of Kerala. Lighting fixtures come in various sizes and shapes suitable for a wide variety of applications. Indian and foreign brands are aplenty. Choosing the device for a particular space and fixing it at an ideal spot can be a challenging task for the ordinary customer. Professional guidance helps to accomplish the desired effect. Light is the most dynamic element of home decor. Home-lighting is much more than just illumination; it is about ambience and mood creation, says Narayanan, marketing manager of Philips, one of the prominent manufacturers of branded decorative and designer lighting systems. The company offers a large number of products for domestic use, with prices ranging from Rs.600 to over Rs.40,000. Indian brands now hold sway in the luminaire market, ending the dominance of foreign products. LED lamps are emerging as the hot favourites in the decorative lighting segment, he says. Planning for the right source of light to suit the style of homes calls for a great deal of planning. Proper lighting can leave a lasting impression, he notes. The decorative home lighting product of the company aims at achieving the twin objective of lighting up homes in a stylish and energy-efficient manner. The product range includes Outstylers, the outdoor lighting system, Room stylers, the indoor home lighting, Aquafit, the stylish bathroom lightings, Ecomoods, the energy-saving lamps, Kids' place for children's lighting, spotlights and table lamps. Philips has special purpose lights in the Living Colours and the Ledino series. Living Colours is a multi-coloured LED lighting system with a provision for adjusting the colour and intensity. The colour and the intensity of light can be adjusted with just a touch. The product is available in a price range of Rs.5,000 to Rs.12,000. Antony V.P., managing director of Indeo Lights, a distributor of various brands of decorative lights, agrees that LED lights are gradually replacing the compact fluorescent lights. The price factor was a deterrent to many customers, but the prices have been on a decline during the past two years. The advantage is lower power consumption. Power savings are the biggest advantage of using LED lights, says Georgekutty Karianappally, managing director of Lifeway Solar Devices Ltd., a Kochi-based company providing lighting solutions for indoor and outdoor purposes. The company's LED range includes in-ground up-light, used to enhance the appeal of walkways, gardens and other outdoor spaces.  R. RAMABHADRAN PILLAI  OPEN",

        "content": " The Supreme Court has held that reservation rules will not apply to upgraded posts in a service which entail only a higher pay scale and no promotion. Where the process is an upgrade simpliciter, there is no need to apply the rules of reservation. The candidate continues to hold the same post without any change in duties and responsibilities and merely gets a higher pay scale, said a Bench of Justices R.V. Raveendran and Markandey Katju. The Bench said: Where there is a restructuring of some cadres resulting in creation of additional posts and filling of those vacancies by those who satisfy the conditions of eligibility, which include a minimum period of service, will attract the rules of reservation. On the other hand, where restructuring of posts does not involve creation of additional posts but merely results in some of the existing posts being placed in a higher grade to provide relief against stagnation, the said process does not invite reservation. The Bench said: Generally, upgrade relates to and applies to all positions in a category [for those] who have completed a minimum period of service. Upgrade can also be restricted to a percentage of posts in a cadre with reference to seniority (instead of being made available to all employees in the category) and it will still be an upgrade simpliciter. But if there is a process of selection or consideration of comparative merit or suitability for granting the upgrade or benefit of advancement to a higher pay scale, it will be a promotion. The Bench said Promotion is an advancement in rank or grade or both and is a step towards advancement to a higher position, grade or honour and dignity. Though in the traditional sense promotion refers to advancement to a higher post, in its wider sense, promotion may include an advancement to a higher pay scale without [the holder] moving to a different post. But the mere fact that both  advancement to a higher position and advancement to a higher pay scale  are described by the common term promotion' does not mean that they are the same. In the instant case, the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd was aggrieved over the orders passed by the Madras Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal and affirmed by the Madras High Court that reservation would apply to upgraded posts in BSNL under the Biennial Cadre Review (BCR) scheme.

        "content": " Stating that the West Bengal Government was willing to pay compensation to Tata Motors under the Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Act, 2011, for any loss the company might have suffered, the State told the Calcutta High Court on Thursday that it had not gained in any way from giving the land of the now relocated Tata Nano small car factory at Singur to the Company. Government Pleader Ashok Banerjee pointed out that the matter of the original acquisition of land at Singur was pending before the Supreme Court and should the apex court strike down the acquisition, the State Government would have to give back the land to the original owners as well as be liable to pay compensation to Tata Motors. The State Government did everything to facilitate the setting up of the automobile plant at Singur, Mr. Banerjee said before Justice I. P. Mukerji, adding that the Company itself had admitted that it had received all cooperation from the State Government. If the acquisition is struck down by the Supreme Court, what will Tata Motors get? Everything  because I have promised compensation. What will I get? Nothing, Mr. Banerjee said. The hearing on the petition filed by Tata Motors challenging the Constitutional validity of the Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Act, 2011, continued during the day. Mr. Banerjee also pointed out that under the West Bengal Land Reform Act, 1960, the State Government was empowered to take back any land given on lease. The State could have taken back the land at Singur without paying any amount to Tata Motors, but the government had instead brought in a new law to provide compensation to the company, he argued. Without the payment of compensation the State could have taken back its land. Tata Motors is asking for compensation. The Act has provided for compensation, he said. He reiterated that the action taken under the Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Act, 2011, was not an acquisition but only a case of the State taking back its own property. Tata Motors had failed to set up the factory merely because of an agitation that went on for ten days, Mr. Banerjee said, adding that when asked if it was interested in setting up the plant, the Company had expressed its inability to do so.

        "content": " A Preliminary Failure Analysis Team constituted to study the flight data of GSLV-F06, which crashed seconds after its launch on December 25, said that the primary cause of the failure was the untimely and inadvertent snapping of a group of 10 connectors located at the base of the Russian Cryogenic stage. The premature snapping of these connectors stopped the flow of control commands to the core First Stage control electronics, leading to the loss of control and breakup of the vehicle, said a press statement from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Friday. The precise cause of the snapping of this set of connectors  whether due to external forces such as vibration or dynamic pressure  is to be analysed further, the statement added. Command signals Some of these connectors carried command signals from the onboard computer located in the Equipment Bay (near the top of the vehicle) to the control electronics of the four L40 strap-ons of the First Stage. These connectors were intended to be separated only during a separation command at 292 seconds after lift-off. The performance of the GSLV-F06 flight (with GSAT-5P Satellite onboard) was normal up to 47.5 seconds from lift-off. The events leading to the failure began at 47.8 seconds after lift-off. Soon, the vehicle started developing larger errors in its orientation leading to build-up of higher angle of attack and higher structural loads, according to ISRO. The vehicle broke up at 53.8 seconds from lift-off. A destruct command was issued from the ground at 64 seconds after lift-off as per the Range safety norms. The Preliminary Failure Analysis Team was chaired by the former ISRO Chairman, G. Madhavan Nair, and analysed the flight data along with members of the Launch Authorisation Board, the Mission Readiness Review Committee as well as senior functionaries of the GSLV Project and experts. The ISRO has now constituted a Failure Analysis Committee to carry out an in-depth analysis of the flight data of GSLV-F06 and data from the previous six flights of GSLV. The committee will establish reasons for the failure of GSLV-F06 and recommend corrective actions on the GSLV vehicle, including the remaining solitary Russian Cryogenic engine. The Failure Analysis Committee has 11 experts drawn from within ISRO and outside. The ISRO has also constituted a Programme Review and Strategy Committee to look into the future of the GSLV Programme and the launches of the INSAT/GSAT Series, INSAT-3D and Chandrayaan-2. It will work towards the operationalisation of the indigenous Cryogenic Stage and come up with a strategy for meeting the demands of communication transponders in the immediate future, the statement said. This seven-member committee will be headed by K. Kasturirangan, former ISRO chairman. These two Committees have been requested to submit their reports by the end of January 2011. The reports will be presented to eminent scientists and engineers, including A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, M.G.K. Menon, Yash Pal, U.R. Rao, K. Kasturirangan, Mr. Madhavan Nair, R. Chidambaram, and R. Narasimha. Internal exercise A panel chaired by S.C. Gupta, former member of Space Commission, will guide and facilitate an internal exercise by the ISRO chairman, and elicit views from the ISRO community at all levels to gear up for the complex and challenging space missions ahead. The ISRO plans to complete these reviews and internal exercises by end of February 2011.

AIADMK leader M. Thambidurai said his party was ready to cooperate with the government on Parliamentary procedures. Basudev Acharia (CPI-M) too said his party was opposed to the disruption of the House. Emerging from the meeting, RLD chief Ajit Singh stressed his party had also conveyed to the Speaker that he wanted the House to function normally. Gurudas Dasgupta (CPI) said he wanted Leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee to take the lead in finding a solution to the deadlock. He observed that the point of no return cannot continue in a Parliamentary system, and appealed to Mr. Mukherjee to help find a solution acceptable to all. So, while all these parties have not given up their demand for a JPC probe, there appeared to be agreement that the budget session should function normally and a solution to end the impasse should be sought actively. Meanwhile, in the January 2, 2011 issue of People's Democracy, the CPI (M)'s party paper, the editorial has suggested the creation of an anti-corruption law: What is requiredis to evolve a set of new regulations, and if necessary laws, to ensure that such massive manipulations of our system permitting colossal loots are prevented in the future. This would be the central agenda of the JPC.

Dr. Swamy said that as a consequence of the rise in money supply, caused by the black money generated through corrupt deals  as in the 2G spectrum allocation, the Commonwealth Games and the Indian Premier League  hoarders have played havoc with cereals, fruits, vegetables and processed foods, with prices skyrocketing. Decline in output Output in the core industries  especially oil-refining, steel, cement and coal  had declined due to inadequate new investments. Moneys stashed away abroad by Indian politicians and business houses, in illegal secret accounts, are expected to enter the stock market through PNs to earn quick capital gains, he said. White-washing crimes Dr. Swamy alleged that despite the mild rebuke by the Supreme Court on inaction by the government in the 2G spectrum issue, Union Ministers Kapil Sibal and Salman Khursheed were busy white-washing the crimes by settling for minor fines and looking for loopholes to exonerate the telecom companies. At the same time, Dr. Swamy lamented that the Opposition parties would not be able to rise to the occasion as their leadership is also tainted by the same scandals as the UPA's.  OPEN",

An official of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation said that wind and rain helped in improving supply last week. From anywhere between four to six hours a day, the situation has deteriorated to six or more a day now. The corporation was supplying power continuously for fours hours a day to micro units. The continuous power supply was in slots to different industrial hubs in the city. This schedule was maintained as a priority to ensure that production was not affected much for the micro units because of power cut. The domestic and other connections in the industrial areas also received power supply according to the schedule. The official said that in the case of longer hours of cut in supply because of problems such as breakdown, the corporation tries to compensate by reducing the regular load shedding. During the last two days, load shedding for one hour early in the morning has resumed because of shortage in availability. According to data available on the Tamilnadu Transmission Corporation website, the loadshedding in the State on Saturday morning was 2,324 MW as against 1,585 MW five days ago.  OPEN",

        "content": " The Wage Boards for working journalists and non-journalists and other newspaper employees submitted their recommendations to the government on Friday, recommending 2.5 to 3 times hike in basic pay and fixing the retirement age at 65. The revised basic pay has been computed after merging the existing basic pay, the dearness allowance and the 30 per cent interim relief already granted besides 35 per cent variable pay, said Chairman of the Wage Boards Justice G.R. Majithia. The recommendations have been proposed to be implemented from January 8, 2008. Taking into account the concept of grade pay introduced in the Sixth Pay Commission, the Boards introduced variable pay' for all employees working in newspaper establishments and news agencies. Consequently, the Boards proposed a variable pay of 35 per cent. This will be implemented from July 1, 2010. As per the recommendation, current basic pay would rise by 2.5 to 3 times, a Wage Board official said. According to an official of the Wage Boards, the basic pay at the entry level could be anywhere around Rs. 9,000 while the basic pay drawn at the senior level could be around Rs. 25,000 in a category 1 media house. Permanent tribunal We have also proposed establishment of a permanent tribunal to redress grievances between employers and employees, Justice Majithia said after presenting the recommendations to the Labour and Employment Secretary Prabhat Chaturvedi. The recommendations would be examined by the Ministry before they are tabled before the Union Cabinet for approval, Mr. Chaturvedi said. The Boards also recommended that the dearness allowance shall be paid by-annually with effect from July 1 and January 1 every year and the rate of neutralisation for determining the DA would be 100 per cent of the basic pay for all groups of employees. It recommended revision of house rent, transport, and night shift allowances, the Chairman said. It has been recommended that the HRA be paid at the rate of 30 per cent, 20 per cent and 10 per cent of the basic pay to employees posted in areas defined as area X, Y and Z respectively. Similarly, transport allowance at the rate of 20 per cent, 10 per cent and five per cent shall be paid by newspaper establishments to its employees posted in respective areas defined as X, Y and Z respectively. The hardship allowance has been recommended at Rs. 1000 for employees working in hilly areas. The employees working in the newspaper establishment of classes I and II and classes III and IV shall be paid medical allowance at the rate of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 per month per employee respectively. But no medical allowance shall be paid to employees who are covered by the Employees State Insurance Corporation. News agencies with a revenue of over Rs. 60 crore have been put in the same place as top rung newspapers following the Boards' reclassification of news papers and news agencies. Consequently, PTI has been put in the top spot with UNI in the second slot. The Boards were constituted three years ago for the purpose of fixing or revising rates of wages in respect of working journalists and non-journalists and other newspaper employees.

Duraisamy, Managing Trustee, Eachanari Vinayagar Narpani Trust, to probe allegations of him grabbing the Eachanari Vinayagar Temple land. According to sources, the police had included Ramakrishnan, a retired government official, Kasilingam, a sub registrar, as accused in the case and slapped charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and use of forged document as genuine and others. They said that when the Commissioner for Land Reforms set aside an appeal and returned in 1995 the temple land, measuring 1.80 acre, following the repeal of a land ceiling act, the accused got together and enabled Mr. Duraisamy take possession of the same and not the Trust by fudging a few records. They should have done so in the trusts name as the land was originally registered in favour of the Trust in 1983. Subsequently, Mr. Duraisamy and others, the sources said, built a wedding hall and enjoyed the benefits therefrom. They did not credit the benefits to the Trust account. The issue came to the fore when the District Collector M. Karunagaran ordered the Coimbatore South Thasildar to probe the issue, following a petition he had received from the Chief Ministers Grievance Cell. The probe revealed certain manipulations, which led the Collector to ask the police to register a case and start investigations. He had also asked the officials of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department to investigate the issue and see if Mr. Duraisamy could be removed from the trusteeship.  OPEN",

        "content": " The Tamil Nadu Nursery, Primary, Matriculation and Higher Secondary Schools Welfare Association has urged the State Government to distribute free of cost all the books under Samacheer Kalvi for Standards I to XII. Addressing a press meet here on Saturday, its general secretary G. Krishnaraj said that the present distribution system was in a complete mess as private schools were having a hard time getting books for the trimester, which was made available just now. The Tamil Nadu Textbook Corporation, from which the private schools have been told to buy the Samacheer books, was frequently running out of stock. It had only one godown in Coimbatore  at Ondipudur  and schools located as far away as Mettupalayam and Pollachi must come down here to buy the books. Distributing the books free, he said, would solve a lot of problems and provide tremendous relief to both schools and students. The Government, which was already giving bicycles and laptops free of cost to students, should also actively consider giving the textbooks similarly. Mr. Krishnaraj said that the books were being given free to Government and aided schools, but private schools alone were asked to purchase them. Further, the association also called for relaxation in Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Acts norms such as mandating the quantum of open space in the schools. This meant many schools would have to purchase additional land, which was an expensive proposition that cannot be afforded by smaller schools. It also called for the constitution of a committee by the State Government to look into the problems faced by self-financing schools in Tamil Nadu, many of which were facing closure due to financial difficulties and other constraints.

        "content": " : Members of the Tamil Nadu Elementary School Teachers Federation staged a daylong protest demonstration here on Saturday, pressing a charter of demands, including revision of pay scales on a par with their central government counterparts and abolition of Teachers Eligibility Test (TET). Boycotting the Cluster Resource Centre (CRC) training programme, scheduled for Saturday, a large number of elementary school teachers, including women took part in the agitation, organised as part of the state-wide stir. Federation district secretary and state treasurer A. Tamilselvan said about 2,800 teachers in the district took part in the agitation, pressing a seven-point charter of demands, including central scale of pay, abolition of contributory pension scheme, TET and revival of old insurance scheme. Flaying the TET system, he said only those who passed the plus two examinations with 50 per cent marks were admitted to the Teacher Training Institutes and they pass out by securing 50 per cent of marks. Subjecting them again to an eligibility test was totally unwarranted, he said. While the fresh graduates could clear the TET with ease, those who had completed their studies 10 years ago, were finding it difficult, he said and demanded the revival of the old system of teachers recruitment based on seniority. He said the teachers were forced to boycott the CRC training as it clashed with the agitation date. The federation had appealed to the authorities to hold the CRC training on some other day, stating that the agitation date was fixed long back, but they refused to change, he said. Dindigul Members of the Federation of Primary School Teachers Associations staged a demonstration here on Saturday. They sought payment of arrears to teachers since 2006. A similar demonstration for the same demands was staged in Theni. Madurai Elementary school teachers of government schools in the district staged a demonstration at Palanganatham on Saturday pressing their demands. C.Sahadevan, former State president, Tamil Nadu Elementary School Teachers Federation, inaugurated the dharna and addressed the teachers. R. Muthukumaran, federations district president, R.Chellapandian, district secretary and D.Vijayaparthiban, general council member of All India Primary Teachers Federation, were among those who spoke. Tirunelveli In the dharna organised at Jawahar Grounds, Palayamkottai, 120 teachers, including 50 women protestors, participated. District president of the association, Balasubramanian, presided over the agitation, in which office-bearers Dharmaraj Franklin, Wilson Barnabas, Siva Nakkeeran and others spoke. Tuticorin M. Sivan, district secretary of the federation, said remuneration of secondary grade teachers of elementary schools should follow the Central pay scale. P. Jeevan, district secretary, presided.  OPEN",

        "content": " The Bharatiya Janata Party at an emergency meeting here on Thursday evening discussed threadbare the question of replacing the Uttarakhand Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and possibly bringing back former Chief Minister B. C. Khanduri who was asked to step down just over two years ago. This follows widespread allegations of corruption against Mr. Pokhriyal and a view within the party that it might lose the State Assembly elections due next year. In June 2009 Mr. Khanduri was asked to make way for Mr. Pokhriyal after clearance for the project was obtained from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The same RSS may now be coming round to the view that Mr. Pokhriyal must be ousted. The BJP Parliamentary Board, the party's highest decision-making forum, met on Thursday evening to discuss the issue. BJP president Nitin Gadkari was in the chair. The view that gained ground was that unless Mr. Pokhriyal is replaced, the party has dim chances of returning to power in the State. Mr. Khanduri has been Mr. L. K. Advani's favourite for this job although he did not command as much support in the State Assembly as did Mr. Pokhriyal. Two years ago when Mr. Khanduri was asked to step down, his condition was that Mr. Pokhriyal and not Mr. Bhagat Singh Koshiari should be his successor. The Board apparently also discussed the contours of Mr. Advani's proposed yatra against corruption that could start early next month.  OPEN",

        "content": " The Supreme Court has held that reservation rules will not apply to upgraded posts in a service which entail only a higher pay scale and no promotion. Where the process is an upgrade simpliciter, there is no need to apply the rules of reservation. The candidate continues to hold the same post without any change in duties and responsibilities and merely gets a higher pay scale, said a Bench of Justices R.V. Raveendran and Markandey Katju. The Bench said: Where there is a restructuring of some cadres resulting in creation of additional posts and filling of those vacancies by those who satisfy the conditions of eligibility, which include a minimum period of service, will attract the rules of reservation. On the other hand, where restructuring of posts does not involve creation of additional posts but merely results in some of the existing posts being placed in a higher grade to provide relief against stagnation, the said process does not invite reservation. The Bench said: Generally, upgrade relates to and applies to all positions in a category [for those] who have completed a minimum period of service. Upgrade can also be restricted to a percentage of posts in a cadre with reference to seniority (instead of being made available to all employees in the category) and it will still be an upgrade simpliciter. But if there is a process of selection or consideration of comparative merit or suitability for granting the upgrade or benefit of advancement to a higher pay scale, it will be a promotion. The Bench said Promotion is an advancement in rank or grade or both and is a step towards advancement to a higher position, grade or honour and dignity. Though in the traditional sense promotion refers to advancement to a higher post, in its wider sense, promotion may include an advancement to a higher pay scale without [the holder] moving to a different post. But the mere fact that both  advancement to a higher position and advancement to a higher pay scale  are described by the common term promotion' does not mean that they are the same. BSNL appeal allowed In the instant case, the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd was aggrieved over the orders passed by the Madras Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal and affirmed by the Madras High Court that reservation would apply to upgraded posts in BSNL under the Biennial Cadre Review (BCR) scheme. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the various orders, the Bench said BCR was an upgrade scheme to give relief against stagnation. It did not involve creation of any new post or advancement to a higher post or any process of selection for conferment of the higher pay scale. Such a scheme of upgrade did not involve rules of reservation.   OPEN",

The THAI Scheme 2010-11 was announced by the government recently to streamline implementation of rural development schemes at the village level. The scheme conceived as a micro-level exercise, envisages habitation level surveys to record the infrastructural deficiencies in rural hinterland and provide urban amenities to rural and semi rural areas. With the objective of bridging the gap in basic amenities in rural habitations, the THAI Scheme would be taken up here in each of the 2,054 habitations in 434 panchayats of the district. Under this, habitation level surveys would be conducted by over 1,000 field-level officers to ascertain the availability of basic infrastructural amenities. For Nagapattinam, block-level committees constituted by deputy block development officers, Panchayat Union Works superintendent, Panchayat president, and Panchayat secretary among others have been appointed. Parameters of survey would include facilities such as roads, drinking water, street lights. Speaking to The Hindu, R.Shankar, Project Officer, District Rural Development Agency, stated that THAI Scheme survey would help address the gaps in basic amenities, when Schemes are taken up in the future. There may be a Panchayat with five habitations, while one or two habitations would have received benefits of infrastructure, and others would have been missed in the process in terms of laying of roads, etc. THAI would help address this, Mr.Shankar told The Hindu.

The State government would launch a one-year plan of action soon after the 100-day programme. During this period, proposals that could not be taken up or completed under the 100-day programme and several new projects would be identified for implementation. The proposed Vision 2030 programme would succeed the one-year plan of action, Mr. Chandy said in an interview with The Hindu. Opportunities The main objective of Vision 2030 is to rediscover Kerala and the enormous opportunities in various sectors in terms of investments and employment, not to mention production and productivity, the Chief Minister said. Since Independence, Kerala can talk only about its losses in terms of development. The Malayali diaspora is quite amazing. They have done very well in every field in their area of domicile. But in the State, Malayalis are a total failure. Earlier, we used to depend on rice and essential commodities on neighbouring States. Things have come to such a pass that Kerala has to depend on other States for raw materials such as husk for the coir industry despite being known as the land of coconut, Mr. Chandy said. The Vision 2030 document would be a modest attempt to address the myriad issues faced by the State. The next generation should be able to find employment in the State itself and those working elsewhere should be able to return home and contribute to its development, Mr. Chandy said. The Chief Minister hoped that the UDF government's new functioning style would help capitalise on the opportunities for growth. I can make claims of crossing a milestone only after Vision 2030 is taken up for implementation, Mr. Chandy said.

Uncertainty, however, continues over the participation of Dr.C.Narayan Reddy, poet and Jnanapeeth awardee, who stole the show at the earlier such conferences by anchoring the proceedings using his mellifluous language, as he is 84. Big literary names of the region such as Darbasayanam Srinivasacharyulu, K. Siva Reddy, N. Gopi, Jimbo Rajender, Devraju Maharaj and Andesri, are among a score of litterateurs attending the conference along famous popular folk singer Goreti Venkanna and other artistes. Besides, hundreds of artistes will be on the dais displaying the popular folk arts of the region -- Chindu Yakshaganam, Bonalu, Dolu Sannai, Gussadi, Lambada, Oggu Katha, Kommu Koya, Pittala Dora, Batukamma, Dommari Aata, Jangamdevara, etc. Twenty two, out of 54 folk arts of the State selected for display at the conference, are from Telangana. While the WTC overall will reflect the unity of the regions thus, it is feared that differences may crop up among the historians attending the conference, over the native place of Bammera Pothana who translated Mahabhagavatham into Telugu. Nearly 5,000 people have registered as delegates for the WTC.  OPEN",

        "content": " Mohammedpur Umri is not the most aesthetically pleasant village you might come across. Its messy and bereft of lush fields; cluttered with broken structures and filth, and overrun by drains. Its awkwardly tucked in behind the Bamrauli Indian Air Force base in West Allahabad, whose barricades keep the commotion of vehicles on the Grand Trunk Road a safe distance away. The sole entry into the village  a narrow, broken track  is in sharp contrast to the smooth tarmac of the air base. Watching the aircrafts fly over keeps the children engaged. Everything else appears dull and disorderly. However, Umri has been documented for much more fascinating reasons. With 120 identical twins in a population of just over a couple of thousand, it has perhaps the highest birth rate of twins anywhere in the world. Even girls born here and married far off have been known to produce twins. The animals, too, produce identical twins once in a while. And naturally, a mass of researchers, medical experts, scientists, students and curious gentry alike, have landed up in the village to find out, why it, of all places, produces so many twins? Various reports and papers released thereafter have tried to answer this: inter-marriage (most of the population is Muslim and cross-cousin marriage is common among them), rare DNA arrangement and chance being some of the simpler explanations. But the village of twins is least bothered. While it rakes in much attention for its biological freak, its more obvious civic and economic neglect seems to have gone unnoticed. The incessant visitors enquiring about the twins often irritate Acchan Mian, also known as Netaji. To deal with it, he keeps a hand-written list of all the twins ready with him. His sons are on the list, too. Medical teams came here from all over: Hyderabad, Allahabad, Lucknow, Singapore even. They took our blood tests. [Giving blood had become a daily routine, he says].But where have they gone? Yes, this village has many twins. But how has it helped us? asks Netaji. Not many of the researchers ever turned up with the results and nothing much has changed in Umri in a lot of years. Proximity to the air base provides it uninterrupted power supply but the benefits end there. The village pleads for basic medical facilities. Most of the births are administered at home and the high death rate of new mothers and newborn twins usually passes off unrecorded. Premature births and pregnancy-related complications also seem to have missed the eye of the administration. Twenty-one-year old Zeeshan puts up his point: When everybody knows about the twins, then how is it possible they never considered improving our medical facilities? The village also has its water woes. Only a few can afford private motors, while the rest depend on the common hand pumps, most of which call for immediate repair. And 20-year-old Tauseef jokes, Sadly, they dont come in pairs. The roads, too, have not changed a bit in the last 15-20 years, he says. If you return after 10 years, you will find them intact. Ram Prajapati, one of the few Hindus living in Umri, blames the village pradhans callousness for it. He is a good man otherwise and helps us personally. But he does not attend any meetings, nor will he approach the authorities for any development work. The authorities never visit this place. How will things improve? The pradhan cites the movement of heavy rollers and tractors  used in illegal sand mining  through the village for the spoiled roads. The villagers, however, refute his claim. Talking of bad roads, on a lighter note, marriages have been held up in the past, simply because the baarat refused to walk on them. The minority Hindus, mostly belonging to Scheduled Caste and Other Backward Castes, say their relationship with the Muslims was amiable and they never face any sort of harassment. Much of the village is engaged in dairy rearing and some farming. But with mounting pressure, some even participate in illegal sand mining. The lone school struggles with teacher absenteeism and lacks study atmosphere. The madrasa will not get you a job. There is no police outpost, either. And, even the smallest of constructions are rife with goonda tax . Even with such difficulties and appalling civic conditions, one cannot discount the peculiarities that accompany such high rate of look-alikes. There is bound to be confusion, and in some cases, that comes to good use for some. A few years ago, a man who was in custody for a petty crime wanted some time out. When his twin brother paid him a visit (wearing the same outfit as him), the two switched places. This worked perfectly for a few rounds, until the police finally got the hint. People have been known to fight with the wrong brother or the wrong person has been beaten up for a crime committed by his brother. In some cases, newly wed women have forced their husbands to dress in a particular way to avoid confusion! Today, however, migration has made it easier to spot the right person, with at least one of the brothers out of station. But migration also means that visitors no longer get to see as many twins together as they would, say, a decade ago. Nevertheless, the instances of twin-confusion never fail to bring laughter to this sleepy, old village.  OPEN",

        "content": " Its not just about environmental pollution and eye-searing litter. The governments recent drive to rid Delhis streets of the ubiquitous plastic bag could mean the difference between life and death for that ancient sacred symbol  the cow. Cows have already fallen victim to human reliance on plastic carry bags, a new animal rights documentary The Plastic Cow argues. The film citesnumerous examples of cows falling ill and dying after years of plastic bag consumption. The holy cow has become a scavenger, its narrator says, voicing overimages of cattle wandering the streets in search of food, dodgingmotorcycles, and chewing garbage, always surrounded by mounds of colourful plastic. Sponsored by animal welfare groups and directed by Kunal Vohra, the documentary film highlights a dichotomy between the countrys religious beliefs and practice. It argues that the cows holy status among Hindus contrasts sharply with the widespread abuse and neglect of the animal throughout India. So far, however, the cow has not received much attention in connection tothe Delhi municipal bodys recent enforcement of its 2009 ban onplastic bags. Though 25 teams from the Delhi governments Environment Department inspected shopping malls and five-star hotels recently, saying the department would impose penalties for the 100-plus violations found, the enforcement drive did little to directly remove plastic bags from city streets, where the cow is most likely to consume the harmful petroleum product. Stray cows and cows unleashed from urban dairy farms at night  a way that farmers save money  often swallow plastic bags in whole to eat the food kept within. The indigestible bags can block food from passing through the cows first stomach, causing bloating and pressure on the diaphragm and ribs, among other symptoms, and might eventually kill the animal, according to a scientific study referenced in the film. One graphic scene showed surgeons pulling more than 50 kg of a thick, grass-covered material from a cows belly. Its a hard, rock-like substance, the doctor said, as an assistant sawed at the plastic with a knife. Its very difficult to remove. Writer and activist Rukmini Sekhar, speaking at a recent screening of the 34-minute film, said, A new tool of destruction has been unleashed upon our animals  the plastic bag. The screening was followed by comments from a panel of animal rights and environmental activists and questions from the audience. The panellists described the negative heath impact of plastics on humans, street animals  especially cows. One viewer, however, wanted to know why the focus was only on the cow. More so, when street dogs, pigs and even children are also exposed to the plastic consumption menace. Its a problem beyond cows, said Shyam Divan, a panellist and a senior advocate for the Plastic Cow Campaign. He described the legal aims of the campaign, which had joined other environmentalist groups filing writs of petition in the Supreme Court calling for a total, national ban on plastic bags. In May 2012, the Court said it might consider the ban. Though the animal rights groups writ argued for the ban on behalf of animals rights, their petition also highlighted human public health concerns, citing studies that described the harmful effects of plastic chemicals like Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) found in cattle milk or meat. Across the globe, animal rights are not recognised yet. Youve got to dress up the challenge in a particular manner, and present the problem as a human-centric issue, Mr. Divan said. If the Court takes up the case, Mr. Divan hoped it would lead to the construction of more physical barriers separating animals from the garbage that overflows from uncollected bins into the streets. The writ itself called for stricter enforcement of garbage disposal laws already in place throughout the country, which mandate that animals must be kept from wandering through waste storage. The Karuna Society for Animals and Nature, the Visakha Society for Protection and Care of Animals, as well as three individuals, were listed as petitioners on the writ. But Ms. Sekhar, for her part, hoped that someday the cow would have enough legal standing to act as its own petitioner, as in the case of the New Zealands Whanganui River, which this September received personhood status under the law. Someday, she said wistfully, animals will be able to sue, too.  Besides its hazardous effects on human health and the environment, free flowing plastic bags on roads and garbage bins are turning into scourges for stray animals, especially cows  OPEN",

        "content": " Attacking the former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa head-on, the Bharatiya Janata Party is learnt to have decided to drop his close aide and Energy Minister Shobha Karandlaje from the Ministry. According to sources in the BJP, the decision, taken at a meeting of the partys core committee held on Saturday, was on account of her embarrassing the government and the party by writing an open letter to Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar highlighting the governments failures in handling of rape cases and also publicly alleging that there was no safety for women in the Chief Ministers home district. Cabinet expansion A party leader told presspersons on condition of anonymity after the meeting that Ms. Karandlaje may be dropped in three to four days time. The government is set to take up the Ministerial expansion in about four days from now to fill up the two vacant berths. She is expected to be dropped by then so that it is possible to induct three persons into the Ministry, he said. Not invited Mr. Shettar is already said to have communicated his displeasure to her over her public remarks. You can go ahead with such public criticism against the government and the Chief Minister, but only after relinquishing the post of Minister, he is learnt to have told her. The anger of the BJP leadership against Ms. Karandlaje was visible as it did not even invite her for the Saturdays chintan baitak programme. She was the only Minister who did not get the invite for the meeting, sources said. It is learnt that the party was waiting for a suitable reason to sack her from the Ministry as she is one of the key members of the camp of Karnataka Janata Paksha president B.S. Yeddyurappa, who is threatening to topple the government. She had earlier embarrassed the party leadership by calling on Mr. Yeddyurappa in the media glare when he formally joined the KJP and quit the BJP. Some of the controversial decisions that had been taken in a hurry by the Energy Department authorities in the last few days too had raised many an eyebrow in the BJP circles. Interestingly, all the Ministers from Mr. Yeddyurappas camp stayed away from the chintan baitak. Meanwhile, BJP State general secretary and MP Pralhad Joshi told presspersons in Bangalore that the party central leadership would take a decision on whether to appoint a new State president for the party soon.

Siddaiah, who returned as Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner for a second stint, has come under the scanner of the Bangalore Metropolitan Task Force (BMTF) as a suspect officer for his alleged role in the DLF case. The BMTF, probing the DLF scam that involved illegal widening of a road to facilitate an increase in the floor area ratio (FAR) of an apartment complex, had named Mr. Siddaiah, his predecessor Bharat Lal Meena, besides the former Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) Commissioner Pradeep Singh Kharola among the three IAS officers whose role had surfaced during its investigation based on oral and documentary evidence. BMTF letter In a letter to Chief Secretary S.V. Ranganath, dated November 29, 2012, the BMTF had sought to place under suspension these three officials, besides 23 others of the BDA and BBMP, to facilitate fair probe. However, the government chose to ignore the BMTFs recommendation and brought Mr. Siddaiah back to the BBMP from the Higher Education Department where he was serving as Principal Secretary, thus replacing Commissioner Rajneesh Goel. The report also names several senior officials of the BBMP and the BDA as suspect officials for having allegedly colluded to allow the DLF to up the FAR for its projects, violating BBMP bylaws and BDAs master plan. Charge against Shettar Meanwhile, RTI activist Dinesh Kallahalli accused Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar of trying to hush up the matter by bringing back the same suspect officials. He plans to seekGovernor H.R. Bhardwajs intervention in the matter as the Chief Minister was involved. Speaking at a press conference here on Saturday, Mr. Kallahalli said Tirakana Goudar, Town Planning Member (TPM) in the BDA, who was reinstated to his post while he was out on bail, was also being favoured by the Chief Minister. DLF violations The BMTF has arrested Mr. Goudar, who was charged with helping DLF Southern Homes legalise construction beyond what was permitted on a civic amenity (CA) site. He was accused of approving the widening of the Hulimavu-Begur Road to legalise DLF Southern Homes illegal construction. DLF constructed 1,962 flats instead of the 440 for which they had taken permission. We are not even able to get documents under the Right to Information Act. We want the Governor to intervene, Mr. Kallahalli said.

Earlier, Maldivians coming to India were using the visa-on-arrival facility, but now those coming in for treatment have to have medical visas. Statistics from Air-India, the only airline that connects Bangalore to Male directly, says at least 70 Maldivian nationals fly directly into Bangalore daily, mostly seeking medical treatment and a few to attend businesses here. However, the new rule by the government puts the cap at 50 daily. While Air India operates daily direct flights to Male, it also operates a flight via Thiruvananathapuram five days a week. Of about 100 passengers that we fly daily on an average in the direct flight, about 70 are Maldivian nationals, Air India spokesperson told The Hindu . The other flight via Thiruvananathapuram, that has a load factor of about 90 to 100 passengers also has a similar ratio, but the numbers get divided between Thiruvananathapuram and Bangalore, he said. The impact of visa restrictions imposed by the Indian government is likely to be felt after the next few weeks, he said. Our booking shows that the load factor has remained the same for the next few weeks, the spokesperson added. The authorities at Immigration in the Bengaluru International Airport and the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) refused to comment on the exact number of Maldivians arriving here. However, according to sources in the medical fraternity, the Maldivian nationals arriving here for medical purpose first check into the hospitals, which in turn will facilitate the registration with the FRRO. Meanwhile, Sandeep Bafna of Travel India Company, which deals with medical tourism, said that most of the Maldivian nationals coming to Bangalore do not go through tour operators, but through references from family and friends. We get very negligible number of enquiries from Maldives, he said, adding that many Maldivian nationals also travel to India for business purposes, mostly related to the hospitality industry. Sanjar Imam, who operates Panache and is vice-president of Karnataka Tourism Forum, also acknowledged that not many tour operators handle medical tourism packages for Maldives, here. Maldivians arrive here primarily seeking medical attention and some for business, he added.

The sub-district came first with 344 points. It stood second in the high school (HS) category with 309 points. In 2012 too, the contestants of the city sub-district had emerged overall champions. This year, they lost the first position in the high-school (HS) category by one point. Koyilandy educational sub-district emerged winners in the category with 310 points. They also bagged the second position in the HSS category with 322 points. In the upper primary (UP) section, the Perambra educational sub-district bagged the first position with 140 points. Koyilandy educational sub-district came second with 131 points. Schools that topped in various categories included Silver Hills HSS, Kozhikode and St. Francis English Medium U.P. School, Perambra. Though the winners managed to spice up the valedictory session with their jubilance and hurray, the crowd was minimal in almost all venues on the concluding day as most of the popular stage items including dance and classical items came to a close on Friday. Only the venues of orchestra and mimicry could draw a fairly good audience. Minister for Panchayats and Social Welfare M.K. Muneer gave away the prizes on Saturday. District panchayat president Kanathil Jameela presided over the function. The organising committee of the festival, comprising teaching staff and peoples representatives, had made elaborate arrangements for the hosting of the five-day fair. Altogether, 16 venues, including the main one at St. Antonys High School, had been arranged in and around Vadakara. According to the organisers, over 5,000 candidates representing 17 educational sub-districts took part in the event. Other than minor criticisms against the judging panel raised by some contestants, there were hardly any problems in the overall conduct, they said. For the announcement of results, the organising committee had launched the blog, kalolsavam.kkd.blogspot.in, with the support of technically competent students. A panel of teachers was assigned to monitor the data upload process and ensure accuracy in the announcement of results. Several sponsors teamed up with the organising committee to meet the festival expenses and prepare the venues. The round-the-clock presence of the police and Student Police Cadets ensured hassle-free conduct of the events, they said.

Sparsh Hospital that had plans to tie up with a new healthcare facility in Maldives is now reconsidering its plans. Sharan S. Patil, chairperson and chief orthopaedic of Sparsh Hospital, told The Hindu that following the clamp on visas, the hospital has decided there was no point in going ahead with the proposal to tie up with hospitals there. The hospital gets more than 30 patients a month from Maldives for surgeries as well as follow-up. As hospitals in Maldives are equipped only with infrastructure for basic health problems, most Maldivians come to India for treatment. The proposal was to send our doctors there to conduct speciality clinics. The idea was to avoid people coming to India even for consultations. But now we are wondering what is the point in going ahead with this proposal, Dr. Patil said. A team from his hospital had planned to visit Maldives in the third week of January to tie up with two private hospitals (ADK and Medicare Primax) there, he said. The Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences also gets nearly four patients a week from Maldives. Institute Director C.N. Manjunath said the cap would deprive Maldivians of quality healthcare. Although some Maldivians also go to Sri Lanka for treatment, most choose India, especially Kerala and Bangalore, Dr. Manjunath said. Sudarshan Ballal, medical director of Manipal Hospitals, said the impact on medical tourism would not be big. All these doctors said that there should be no restrictions on medical tourism. Medical infrastructure in our country is chosen by most international patients because of the expertise of doctors here and world-class medical and surgical care at affordable costs, apart from the favourable climatic conditions. Such restrictions will send a wrong message , Dr. Patil added.  OPEN",

        "content": " Microsofts brand new version of its flagship product, the Windows operating system, has pitted it once again against Linux users who have had a longstanding battle with the giant. The Linux community has been particularly offended by the operating systems Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), or popularly known as Secure Boot. The GNU Linux communitys fundamental objection to the feature is that it amounts to collusion between Microsoft and hardware manufacturers to lock users, depriving them of the freedom to install other operating systems in a Windows environment. They were later mollified by Microsofts clarifications that there will be a Secure Boot-disable option on PCs shipping with Windows 8. Although this option would have allowed installation of multiple operating systems, it is still arduous on Secure Boot machines. Secure Boot is deemed as an attempt by Microsoft to tighten its losing grip in the desktop space and grab onto a substantial user base in the tablet space. With the release of Windows 8 and Microsofts tablet computer Surface, there is some clarity about the implications of Secure Boot. As the Redmond giant provides an option for multi boot on Intel or AMD processor-based computers (seen with Windows 8), and no such option for ARM-based computers, the restriction might play out differently in the tablet market (manifested in Microsoft Surface). It would create unhealthy competition in the long run, if Microsoft-certified ARM devices make it big in the tablet computer segment, and eliminate other operating systems from the race with a hardware lock in the form of Secure Boot. If you have a personal computer, or a laptop that you purchased a couple of years ago, the first wake-up screen would most likely be a dull visual with a pixelated logo and text in a monotonous font with keyboard access to only a few obscure device options. This wake-up system software, that has existed from the first IBM PC, is mostly the only piece of computer ware that has never seen any major upgrades. The Basic Input/Output System (or commonly known as the BIOS) is the firmware that initiates the device wake-up, before the operating system can be loaded. With UEFI, this interface between the device firmware and the operating system will make the interface advanced, firstly, and more importantly, prevent malicious software that attack the BIOS (rootkits) from hampering the functioning of the operating system. The initiative of Intel and now the consortium UEFI is trying to make the boot process of computers more secure. Secure or restricted? Boot restrictions arent new in the industry. All Apple products come with restricted boot. Tablets and phones running Android too do not allow multi boot. With the Microsoft version of UEFI Secure Boot, it has joined the league of restricted boot operating systems. If Microsoft is not alone, why is it being targeted? A blog post on Free Software Foundation website reads, When done correctly, Secure Boot is designed to protect against malware by preventing computers from loading unauthorised binary programs when booting. In the case of the Microsoft implementation, it hasnt been done correctly. Making the apprehensions of Free Software crowd come true, Microsoft has now made it mandatory for ARM-based devices to have Secure Boot on, without an option to disable it. This means ARM-based devices certified for Windows do not have the option of booting into another operating system (unless the operating system in question is also certified by Microsoft). Impact on market While Free Software community and technologists who want multi boot are agitated with this ARM lock by Microsoft, from a market point of view, it does not seem like a threat, at least as yet. Microsoft is not imposing the Secure Boot restriction in the desktop space, which is almost entirely ruled by Intel or AMD machines running Microsoft Windows. If Microsoft had imposed Secure Boot on desktop platforms, they might have faced a second antitrust action, because they are still the monopoly in personal computer operating systems.  OPEN",

Mani, an accused in the murder of Congress activists, has reiterated that the United Democratic Front (UDF) government is slapping trumped-up charges against CPI(M) activists with the intention of destroying the party. Mr. Mani, who has relocated himself to Kottayam following a High Court directive not to remain in Idukki (made as part of the conditions while granting bail on Friday), was inaugurating the fourth days agitation at Metran Kayal, near Kumarakom, being taken up by the party as part of its land stir. He alleged that Home Minister Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan had implicated innocent persons in the T.P. Chandrasekharan murder case. Mr. Radhakrishnans narrow victory in Kottayam was on account of the compromises he had made communal forces, and as a Minister, he was paying for it, Mr. Mani said. In an apparent reference to the Communist Party of India, Mr. Mani said that while resistance from the UDF leadership to the land agitation was understandable, certain other political parties, in an effort to cover up their incapability to take up such agitations, had taken a negative attitude. The CPI(M) agitation would intensify in the coming days, he said, as the UDF was continuing its support to the land mafia. Hundreds of volunteers participated in the land agitation. Mr. Mani, following the court directive, has made his relatives house at Padua, near Kidangoor, his temporary residence.  OPEN",

He emphasised that students need to understand that duties and rights go hand in hand and that each individual is entitled to fulfil his duties before his rights are claimed. He reiterated that the more rights we have, the greater our responsibilities to the country. Students put up a variety of performing arts to convey the message of they too have a right to live. Each programme revolved around the atrocities and oppressions of several groups in the name of caste, creed, race, colour, economic status and political boundaries. The dance drama portrayed the deplorable plight of women across the country. The innovative puppet show sensitised about the rights of the stigmatised class of people such as HIV-affected, transgenders and juvenile delinquents. The villu paattu was a composition of an album of songs with the essence of the fundamental rights. It was a blend of information and entertainment. A beautiful poem on waiting for one day to come pulled a string at the hearts of the young. The dramatisation of the poem was a heart rending depiction of the solitary and tormented lives of the senior citizens. The tableau on the fundamental duties reminded the audience of their prime responsibilities towards the country.

Over a lakh devotees of Lord Basaveshwara participated in the function. Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, who took part in the utsav, announced that this would be an annual affair. The year kept the district administration busy with elections to rural local bodies. Elections to gram panchayats were held in May, and elections to the zilla and taluk panchayat were held in December. There were some political changes in the district that will have a long-term impact on the district. The former Minister Gurupadappa Nagamarapalli, who had joined the BJP before the Assembly bypoll had differences with the BJP district leadership. He stayed away from the party's campaign in the ZP and TP elections. Though he has not joined any other party till now, his followers fought the ZP and TP polls as JD(S) nominees. Similarly, Congress MLA Rajshekar Patil from Humnabad walked away from a Congress election meeting before the panchayat polls. His followers contested the ZP and TP polls as Independents challenging the Congress candidates. It is not clear whether Mr. Patil will stay in the Congress for some time or join the BJP as his father and MLC Basavaraj Patil Humnabad did last year. A much-needed boost was given to tourism when the Archaeological Survey of India won cases against people who had encroached land around historical monuments. And, Bidar was mentioned in BBC's popular tourist guide Lonely Planet. The State Government transferred Deputy Commissioner Harsh Gupta, who had his share of popularity and controversy. He had gained popularity for taking up several development works. However, controversy arose when he launched the demolition drive in the district.

He told The Hindu that the Irulars wanted to pursue education and come up in life but the lack of basic amenities and denial of community certificates to the students by the revenue officials were reasons for their backwardness. Jobs These Irulars have given up their trade and have now taken up jobs either as daily wage earners or pick up forest produce for their livelihood. Though these people have been living in this hamlet for close to three generations, only a handful among them have managed to get houses built by the Tribal Welfare Board. Even in this colony, roads, streetlights or water facilities are a rarity. Drinking water is supplied at only one spot, at the entrance of the village and since it is insufficient, the Irulas draw water from an open well. P. Madhu, a resident of the colony, alleged that there was corruption in the identification of beneficiaries for the Kalaignar Housing Scheme. The Irulars also said that they were finding it difficult to obtain community certificates and charged the officials with corruption. It was only after the intervention of Mr P. Dillibabu that the district administration issued about 130 certificates. The Irulars also have a long list of complaints. These include the denial of old aged pension to over 30 senior citizens and 30 students needing to trek two kilometres to Theerthamalai if they wanted to pursue school studies beyond middle school.

The programme aimed at giving training to the drivers who were off the road for a short period of few months. Driving requires constant practice and any break for a few months will have an adverse impact on driving skills, says N. Balagurunathan, Regional Transport Officer. He appealed to the drivers who have been off the road to register their names with the RTO office to be called for the training. It has been planned to impart the refreshing skills in batches. Titled Know your vehicle', the training would help drivers recall certain precautionary measures. Drivers belonging to Pudukottai district alone would be eligible for the training. Divided into five major components, the drivers would undergo training on defensive driving', yoga and traffic rules. The thrust would be on proper upkeep of vision. Explaining the strategy evolved by A. Suganthi, Collector, he said the refresher programme would be organised at the office of the Regional Transport Officer in turns throughout the year. The drivers would undergo the training in batches once in a month. Each batch would comprise 60 drivers and it has been planned to benefit 600 to 700 drivers every year, he said.

The existing system prevented States from utilising the Plan fund as per their respective needs. If that freedom could not be given for the entire fund allocation, freedom for a portion of the same within the framework of guidelines should be given, he said.  OPEN",

        "content": " The four Government blood banks in the city reported a considerable increase in voluntary blood donation during 2012 over the preceding year. While 2011 saw a total of 11,497 units being received through 131 camps, Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) District Programme Manager (District AIDS Prevention Control Unit) B. Mohamed Ali told The Hindu on Friday that 13,348 units were collected in 2012 through 173 camps. Given that just one pint of blood could be used to save the lives of four persons, this increase of 1,851 units is invaluable. All of the blood received by the blood banks at Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH), Mettupalayam Government Hospital, Pollachi Government Hospital and ESI Hospital is completely from voluntary donation. From a unit of blood, blood platelets, packed cells, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate could be extracted to meet the different requirements. This increase has been achieved by a concerted drive undertaken among college students by TANSACS which had provided Rs. 7.38 lakh in the last one year to the 143 Red Ribbon Clubs run through the universities of Bharathiar, Avinashilingam, Amirtha and Karunya besides Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU). These funds, he said, was utilised for conducting safe blood donation and IEC (information, education and communication) activities on HIV/AIDS. A Celebration of Life programme featuring Ten Commandments for leading a responsible life is also done. Safe storage Dr. Mohamed Ali said that the focus of these initiatives was to ensure that safe practices were adhered to in blood donation and that stringent safety standards were maintained as unsafe blood transfusion was one of the ways in which HIV/AIDS gets transmitted. Even though these four Government blood banks here were run by different agencies, he said that TANSACS provided them with assistance such as a counsellor and technician, testing kits to ascertain if the blood being donated was safe, storage units and ELISA monitoring units and consumables (snacks) given to donors besides a blood transportation van that could be used to quickly transport blood in times of an epidemic breakout or disaster. Commenting on the drop recorded at ESI Hospital Singanallur, Dr. Mohamed Ali said that they have a limited resource pool as only those registered with the ESIC could donate blood. The hospital had no control over the number of patients or visitors to the institute. As regards Pollachi Government Hospital, he said that after the bifurcation of Tirupur from Coimbatore district, many people began to go to the Udumelpet Blood Bank which was closer to these areas.

Besides covering both existing and new ones, these conditions are applicable for all pools located in Government institutions, private hotels and resorts, apart from educational establishments. The first permission under these new norms was issued in the city on January 5 to a private swimming pool at Periyanaickenpalayam, Deputy Director of Health Services R. Damodharan told The Hindu . Aside from mandating chlorination level of exactly 0.5 ppm (particles per million), as anything above or less would cause health problems, the Department had made it compulsory for the water to be tested for bacteriological contamination at frequent intervals. It had also directed all pools to employ trained swimmers at all times, rather than call them during an emergency, and also provide quality life jackets rather than use of dubious substitutes such as tyre tubes. It had been made imperative, he said, that infected persons should not be allowed to enter the pool. Further, head caps have also been made a must-wear to prevent conditions like dandruff from spreading. All pool operators must employ rapid filters that function while the pool is in use. Showers were required for all those entering the pool, whose depth must not exceed 5.5 ft. Permission must also be obtained from the local body concerned and Fire and Rescue Services Department. Anti-slip tiles must be laid around the pool. Elaborating on the reasons for these directives, Dr. Damodharan said that public awareness on safe practices while entering swimming pools was low. Even many pool operators remained unaware of the safety procedures to be adhered to. While Health Inspectors would monitor the compliance of pool owners, Block Health Supervisors were empowered under the Public Health Acts Section 41 read along with Section 44 to take penal action against those found violating these norms.

We studied how commuters leave the station premises. We found that they moved out through different exit points. Because of this, it becomes difficult for RPF personnel to monitor all the gates at the same time, said a Southern Railway source. Officials felt that if all commuters descended down the same staircase and used only one exit point, it would be easier for the RPF to monitor the crowd and prevent any untoward incidents. It was felt that even criminals would be less likely to snatch chains or misbehave with women if this were so, said the source.

        "content": " With the rollout of digital addressable system (DAS) for television viewing imminent in the city, a package of woes awaits subscribers in the State. Two things appear inevitable: the average spending by households on TV viewing is bound to increase and the choices on offer are not going to be too consumer-friendly. The multi-system operators (MSOs) and local cable operators have been lobbying for advances  ranging from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000  for digital set-top boxes (STBs), and there have been periodic blackouts of channels to urge consumers to buy STBs. Deadlines many The city has already missed the October 31 deadline set by the ministry of information and broadcasting. Initially, it was due to a case in the Madras High Court, and subsequently due to a confusing scenario of bickering and blinking in which neither the Ministry nor broadcasters or MSOs informed when they would discontinue analog signals and switch over to the mandated digital mode. Under the DAS regime, every television set would require a digital STB to view any channel, including the free-to-air ones hitherto provided by cable operators here for a basic tier charge of Rs. 100. While an STB  from either a cable operator or a DTH service provider  would set back a consumer by a fee ranging from Rs. 1,300 to Rs. 2,000 (for standard-definition boxes), the bouquets on offer are likely to inflate monthly bills further. Blackouts not the way Roop Sharma, president of Cable Operators Federations of India (COFI), also one of the members of the task force committee constituted by the Ministry for the rollout of DAS, said it was unfortunate that channels were being blacked out by broadcasters and MSOs, on the insistence of the Ministry, to literally force consumers to opt for DAS. It should be a choice they make based on what is good for them, she said. What is the hurry in switching signal feed from analog to digital when billing is still in analog mode? How will this ensure the money goes to the government? she said. On how the rollout had favoured consumers in New Delhi and Mumbai (where the Ministry claimed the DAS rollout had been successful), Ms. Sharma said it had been a lose-lose equation. Other metros The situation has hardly proved beneficial to consumers. Even the STBs the MSOs have distributed to consumers have not been billed properly. They have claimed advances or full payment as activation charges. At the end of the day, consumers cannot even claim ownership of the boxes. Also, the government has not received VAT on the boxes, she said. Cable TV unexplored In Chennai, for most residents it seems a hard choice to make between DTH and Cable TV. Despite cable TV having the opportunity to expand its services into offerings like broadband internet and video-on-demand, the services in Chennai have hardly explored the avenue. The basic-tier bouquet for cable TV has been set around Rs. 100 whereas the basic tier for most DTH service packages starts in excess of Rs. 150. A cable TV subscriber who recently shifted to a DTH service ended up with a monthly bill in excess of Rs. 350 to access the same channels he was viewing, till last month, for a cost of less than Rs. 200. The basic packages offered by DTH services do not have the free-to-air Tamil channels available in the conditional access system (CAS) regime that was in effect till October 2012. The consumers are not consulted by any of the services before basic packages are designed, Ms. Sharma said.  OPEN",

He noted that of the 430 licensed porters working in the Division, 315 were declared medically fit and were absorbed as gangmen while the rest were declared unfit and couldnt be absorbed and were leading miserable lives with their families. He appealed to the Minister to provide them alternative jobs such as Safaiwalas, care takers and store khalasis. CWA plea The Civic Welfare Association, GVMC, Zone-1, Madhurawada, appealed to Mr. Suryaprakash Reddy to sanction a Railway Reservation Centre at Madhurawada, which has a population of 2.5 lakhs and is about 15 km away from the Railway Station, for the convenience of residents. Association honorary president Pothina Sambasiva Rao and others noted that the GVMC had agreed to provide accommodation, if the Railways sanction the reservation centre.

While India holds different fascinations for these 28 travellers who come from seven countries, the penchant for adventure travel is what they share in common. For the next seven days they will be touring south India in what they call India's workhorse - the rickshaw, as part of the fifth Annual Rickshaw Challenge-Classic Run-2011, that was flagged off at Hotel Residency Towers here on Friday. For avid travellers Szilvia and Tamas K. from Hungary who have covered the whole of north India on earlier visits, the chance to see south India is what they are most excited about. It seems we come to a different country every time, Amritsar is so different from Goa, and so is Bombay from Chennai, says Tamas, adding that the search for something uniquely Indian is what has fuelled their journeys. The rickshaw is such a social leveller, we might dislike the auto- drivers, but the auto is so Indian, says Aravind Bremanandam, the organiser of the event, and founder, Chennai Event Management Services. Tourists want to be informed travellers now and experience every inch of the vacation, he says. This is a better way to meet people, and talk to them, especially children, says Melissa Sayres, a nurse from the U.S, showing off her autorickshaw filled with goodies and souvenirs to be handed to people she will meet enroute. Many of them have their diaries ready too, to jot down their experiences, and the prospect of New Year celebrations in Puducherry leaves them pretty excited. Training sessions on driving an autorickshaw and handling minor repairs in the vehicle have worked well in preparing them for the adventure, they say. What better than spending your vacation with like-minded people from all over the globe, in a magical place like this, says Jonathan K. from Canada. After rock climbing in Cambodia and an expedition in Kilimanjaro, a road trip in India was a natural choice for him, he adds. And while Ian Byran, from Australia is all praise for authentic Tamil Nadu cuisine, he is equally petrified at the thought of encountering rash drivers especially on the highway. Tan Sirisak, from the U.S., prays that the weather remains pleasant. Driving a rickshaw amid showers is not enjoyable, he grins. Filled with treasure hunts, parties and tourist workshops, the seven-day trip will end at Poovar in Kerala after covering Thanjavur, Madurai, Tuticorin, Courtallam and Kanyakumari on the way.

        "content": " Ensuring safety of the road users requires all the departments and organisations concerned to come together and address the problems. The need of the hour is a multi-dimensional approach to road safety, Transport Commissioner M. Rajaram said here on Friday. He was speaking at a programme organised by the Indian Roads and Transport Development Association (IRTDA) and Motor Vehicles and Allied Industries Association (MVAIA). Right from relocating the electricity poles, taking the telecom cables underground and constructing more bridges and bypasses to easing traffic congestion by diverting traffic and encouraging travel by public transport, there is a need for plenty of measures to reduce road accidents, he said. It is unfortunate that the State accounts for the maximum number of road fatalities in the country, with most of them occurring due to violations of road safety rules, he said. The road safety week that begins on Saturday will include many awareness programmes on the theme Road safety is a vision, not an intermission, Dr. Rajaram said. He said Rs.40 crore had been spent on road safety programmes in the last four years. It was also important to invest on road improvements that include identifying bad roads, improving the lighting systems and mending the broken junctions, which is being done now, he added. Awareness programmes are also needed for villagers who damage the median to walk across the highways, and due to lack of judgment become road accident victims, he said. Contrary to the myth that accidents occur only on bad roads, he said a majority of accidents occurred on properly laid roads. Drunk driving, driving without helmet and use of cell phones while driving are some reasons for such fatalities, he added. Polytechnic colleges, IITs and other colleges should impart skill-based driving training to young people, so that every pass out is also a conscious driver, he said. On the need to monitor the quality of training imparted in driving schools, he said, Many driving schools do not train candidates on defensive driving, hence many overtaking instances lead to head  on collisions, he said. Issuing of smart cards would help in monitoring issue of licences and traffic violations at the national level. On implementation, the regular offenders would not be able to get a licence from another RTO, he said. IRTDA chairman K. N. Krishnamurthy, MVAIA chairman Bharath Chordia, and IRTDA and MVAIA Secretary K. Srinivasan participated in the programme.  OPEN",

        "content": " I have often come across the notion that in America, I am an Indian, and in India, I am an American. It made me wonder if I properly identified with either country, being strongly interested in Carnatic music, yet raised in California. My friends in America found it bizarre that I would visit Chennai once or twice a year, and that I was a south Indian vocalist. At times, I found it bizarre myself. But having been a resident of Chennai for the last four years, I realise that I'm fortunate enough to identify with both countries and cultures. Moving to another country is never an easy or quick decision, and my move in November 2006 from Los Angeles to Chennai was no exception. Although I did spend a year in Chennai learning music when I was 11 years old, I did not really consider living in India to be a real possibility. During school holidays, many Indian-American children visit Chennai to learn more about their culture, specifically music and dance. As I continued to visit India throughout high school, my passion for music grew but remained secondary to my studies. School is always first, my parents reminded me. However, after just my first term in college, my guru Sanjay Subrahmanyan urged me to take music seriously and think about pursuing it as a full-time career. The idea seemed outrageous to me then, as I was already going down the usual path of attending a university, and expecting to find a job and work somewhere in the U.S. after completing my course. I returned to college in California after that music season, but my mindset was definitely starting to change. I was finally seeing that perhaps there was a future in music. By the end of the third year of my course, I had decided that I would move to Chennai upon graduation in 2006. I should also credit my brother, Nirmal Narayan, for making my move a little easier as he had already been living in Chennai for one and a half years at that point. Being a mridangam artist, and a student of Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman, he had decided to spend some time immersed in the Carnatic scene. Joining him in Chennai, I surrounded myself with music and began to take things more seriously. However, both of us faced our respective issues and the process of trying to be taken seriously as professional musicians has been no cake walk. For starters, the label of being an NRI' musician is often extremely difficult to shed. Occasionally I run into a sabha secretary who would ask when I got into town! Explaining that I have moved to Chennai can be tiring at times, but it's something one gets used to and it just furthers the idea that one must live in Chennai to become a serious Carnatic musician. Upon my trips to the U.S., I have had the opportunity to perform in many cities. It is interesting to see that in some places, I am received as a local product of the U.S., and in others, as someone from Chennai. In the States also, there seems to be an understanding that a musician coming from Chennai has gone through more rigorous training and has perhaps reached a higher level of competency. I sometimes remind them that although the majority of my musical education has taken place in Chennai, my upbringing was back in the States, where I received my fundamental training in music. For most individuals who are able to pursue their passion, work rarely feels like work' in the negative sense. I recognise my fortunate opportunity to do something I love and make it my profession. Although the temptation to go back to the U.S. and return to the American way of life can loom over one's head, I know that if I were there I would always miss the music scene and concert opportunities that I have in India. Performing regularly in Chennai and constantly challenging one to reach greater heights helps an individual grow both as a musician and a person. It's comforting to see all the efforts to pursue my passion have been worthwhile. Sandeep Narayan is a young Carnatic vocalist from Southern California.

        "content": " For people like Gaurav Kumar, parked vehicles are a nightmare. He lives right next to a multi-specialty hospital in Kilpauk. Getting in and out of his home is an ordeal. The side street on which he lives is taken over by an array of cars and two-wheelers on most days. The concept of public space has become a joke in the city. Every inch is taken over. My children find it difficult to even step out and go to school, Mr.Kumar says. A two-storeyed underground parking lot was inaugurated on Sunday at the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) to provide relief to motorists using the terminus, but a citywide solution to the problem of unregulated parking seems distant. Chennai still lacks a parking policy and the absence of demarcated parking zones has resulted in motorists taking over even pedestrian space, making the city unwalkable. A study Parking requirements of Chennai Metropolitan Area' undertaken by Wilbur Smith Associates in 2003 says that haphazard on-street parking leads to an average loss in road capacity of over 40 per cent. The government's answer is to build multi-level parking facilities. Chennai Corporation Commissioner D. Kathikeyan said: Our approach is to build as many multi-level car parks as possible. After years of delay, the Corporation has commenced work on two such facilities. But is the government adopting the right strategy? Parking is a subset of the congestion problem that the city is going through. The number of private vehicles in the city per 100 residents increased eight-fold between 1981 and 2010. G. Malarvizhi, professor at the Transportation Engineering Division, Anna University, who has done a study on parking problems in the city's central business districts, says that the demand for parking is infinite and the city cannot keep building multi-storey facilities. Parking has to be priced at a premium. The city's Development Control Regulations must reflect time-specific and locality-specific changes. For example, according to current regulations, a hospital based in T. Nagar is mandated to have the same amount of setbacks and parking space as one in Washermenpet. Ms. Malarvizhi says that most of the measures being taken to address the issue are focussed on demand management, instead of policy intervention. Parking must be used as a tool to control the movement of private vehicles. Instead, we are allowing demand to go up by providing free parking on most city roads and then we change standards when it becomes difficult to enforce, she adds. Her projections indicate that parking demand in T. Nagar will increase five-fold by 2016 if restrictions on entry of vehicles are not imposed. Globally, it has been proved that parking fees can indirectly incentivise public transport. Shenzhen in China recently tripled parking charges and parking demand immediately dropped by 30 per cent. A recent Asian Cities Parking Study done by the Asian Development Bank across 14 cities finds that most of the cities are adopting an auto-centric parking strategy that has now been discarded by Western cities. It shows that a surprising proportion of parking is free for motorists, even in dense cities with high property prices. Bhure Lal, Chairman of the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), a committee set up by the Supreme Court to monitor public policy in the National Capital Region, says that 9-10 per cent of Delhi's area is required to provide adequate parking for vehicles. The existing policy perpetrates hidden subsidy to rich car owners as the cost of using up scarce and valuable urban space for parking are not recovered through proper pricing and taxes, he adds.

So much so that the Cabinet Sub-Committee comprising about half-a-dozen ministers besides the Chairman of the State Cultural Council, specially constituted to oversee the arrangements for the high-profile event, is meeting at Tirupati on Monday to take stock of the situation. The Ministers along with other senior officials are expected to visit the Veterinary College grounds, the main venue where arrangements are at feverish pitch to put in place a mammoth auditorium to accommodate about 10,000 delegates and a huge podium. The ministers are likely to take a look at another five smaller auditoriums coming up close-by to host events meant to show-case the socio-cultural and literary facets of the Telugus. The committee comprising ministers D.K. Aruna, Vatti Vasantha Kumar, D. Parthasarathy and others will wrap up the 3-hour programme with a review meeting to be attended by the Executive Officer of the TTD, District Collector, Chittoor, top state police officials and others including senior engineers of the TTD, R&B, Electricity department. Security blanket Meanwhile, an impregnable security blanket is being sought to be provided around the venue and the whole city as well in view of the visit of not only the President Pranab Mukherjee but several other top dignitaries as well, besides a huge contingent of delegates from home and abroad, not to speak of the numerous cultural troupes. IG of Police (Rayalaseema) Govind Singh and the DIG, Anantapur Range, Charu Sinha along with the SPs of Tirupati Urban Police and Chittoor are said to be working on a tight security frame-work. A posse of forces representing different security agencies armed with latest gadgets are expected to be deployed at all vulnerable points both in the town and at the sprawling venue. Carrot and stick policy Meanwhile, in view of a marked lack of enthusiasm among the local traders and business establishments to have their sign boards and publicity hoardings in Telugu despite repeated appeals from the WTC organisers, the Tirupati Corporation authorities are adopting a carrot and stick policy to make the traders fall in line. Starting with Gandhigiria gentle reminder by offering them a rose flower each, the civic authorities are also subtly warning them that they might lose their licences if they failed to respond to the requests. To build the tempo for the WTC, the educational institutions have started holding many literary and cultural events like Bhuvana Vijayam, Kavi Sammelanams etc.  OPEN",

The civic body has recently served a termination notice on the contractor for undue delay in completion of the work and took steps to execute the bank guarantee of Rs. 1.2 crore, given by the contractor. Though work order was given in September 22, 2007, the contractor failed to complete the work in a years time. Corporation Commissioner M. Ashokan told The Hindu that the contractor should honour the commitment and complete the remaining 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the pending works on time. Extension of Bank Guarantee has been sought from the contractor for the extended period till March 2013, he added. The Rs. 31.50-crore project, implemented in stages of nine packages is funded by Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure Financial Services Limited with a loan of Rs. 18.50 crore and grant of Rs. 9.85 crore, while the corporations share is Rs. 3.50 crore. A sum of Rs. 25 crore had already been spent on the project to desilt the 5.66 km-long river, strengthen bunds and bed using concrete, construction of three bridges over the river and construction of baby channels. Accumulated garbage, choked plastic waste, mixing of drain water across the city had turned it into a major sewer channel. Tardy implementation of project has irked the city residents as little progress has been made in the last two years, and no works carried out in last six months.

        "content": " Salt pans spreading over 2,350 acres at Marakkanam in Villupuram district have been hit by the recent rains. The inundation caused by the run-off rainwater from the upland has not only diluted the brine quality of storage in the pans but also reduced the volume of salt production. Preliminary estimate reveals that annual salt production in the region has fallen by half, triggering shortage and price rise. It would have its fallout on the next season's production and the price factor as well. This is vouched by sources from the Salt Department of the Union Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Sources told The Hindu that of the total area of 2,350 acres under salt, 1,200 acres was owned by the State government and the remaining by the Union government. Besides, there is a private salt producer having salt pans on 25 acres of patta land. The annual salt production in the region was in the range of 60,000 tonnes to 80,000 tonnes. Two sources Salt was obtained from two sources - sea brine and sub-soil brine. While the former accounted for 60 to 65 per cent, the latter contributed to 35 to 40 per cent. Intermittent rain during the north-east monsoon period had dimmed the prospects of getting a bumper yield of salt, sources said. January 15 used to be the day for commencement of salt scrapping, coinciding with the agricultural harvest. However, the rain had played havoc and what was left of the pans now was sub-standard salt with reduced brine characteristics. Thin deposits Though the pans were now cleared of water stagnation, only thin deposit of salt could be seen with all kinds of impurities, sources said. Some of the pans, in fact, had become fish breeding grounds. Sources predicted that there was every possibility of the salt prices spiralling, with little prospects of showing any downtrend in the near future. The pre-monsoon prices were at Rs. 100 to Rs. 125 a quintal but the post-monsoon prices had shot up to Rs.160 to Rs.175 a quintal. There was every likelihood of the prices going up further because the existing thin stock, a carry-over from the previous season that lasted seven to eight months, could hardly meet the market demand for the next couple of months. As many as 1,000 families were eking out a living from the salt pans, but rain damage had burned a hole in their pockets. Therefore, they would have to look for sundry jobs in the agricultural sector for a limited period, sources said. As regards compensation package, the sources said that the actual losses would be known only after a Central committee made its assessment.

He [Mr. Ali] has been designated to hold discussions [with Tecom] as a last resort to resolve the disputes [between Tecom and the State government]. Whether or not he is a representative of the State or a mediator is not the topic of discussion, the Minister said, when it was pointed out that SmartCity Kochi Chief Executive Officer Fareed Abdulrahman had called Mr. Ali, a representative of the State. The government stands firm in its position that freehold over property with the right to sell it will not be granted. We will not deviate from it. This has been made clear to Dubai government representatives and the top Tecom management. The consultations held by Mr. Ali are also along those lines.

The government is worried over the impact of the Tribunal's verdict. Andhra Pradesh, which enjoyed rights on surplus water as the lowest riparian State, will be adversely affected as surplus water calculated on the basis of 65 per cent dependability had been divided among the three States. Senior officials including Secretary, Major Irrigation, S.K. Joshi, remained tight-lipped beyond saying that the government could take a view after closely examining all the aspects of the judgment. It will be too premature to comment without examining the contents thoroughly, he said. The experts have been asked to identify the plusses and minuses'' of the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal's order. The government will be in a position to take a view by January 3 as experts are likely to take another couple of days, a senior CMO official said when asked whether there was any plan to approach the Tribunal again. It is feared that the verdict would not only jeopardise the ongoing projects in the Krishna basin, particularly in Rayalaseema, but might also impact power generation from Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar. One major cause of concern is the permission given to Karnataka to raise the height of Almatti dam to 524 metres as this would affect releases to the hydro-electric projects.   OPEN",

Speaking to reporters after presenting a memorandum to Mr. Bhardwaj, they said the participation of 14 BJP legislators, including seven Ministers, in the Karnataka Janata Paksha convention in Haveri attracted action under 10th Schedule of the Anti-Defection Law. The memorandum listed the names of the MLAs who had attended the convention to buttress their claim that the BJP government had lost its majority. Mr. Siddaramaiah said three BJP MLAs had switched loyalties to the BSR Congress, and with this the strength of the BJP had come down to 100 in the Assembly.

        "content": " An old friend of mine used to tell me an apocryphal story relating to Poet Byron. It seems the poet was so handsome and meant so much in English society that urchins used to limp like him . When I listen to a concert of the modern vidwan I am reminded of that story. Almost without exception the young vidwans of today imitate one musician, not only in his music but in his manners also. It is Mr. G.N. Balasubramaniam [1910-1965] Be it said to the credit of Mr. Balasubramaniam that he deplored this in no uncertain terms. He told me that his advice to his pupils was always to cultivate a good voice, both in range and depth. Unless an artiste is endowed with a good voice, his scholarship would be of little avail. Though only in his forties, Mr. Balasubramaniam's views on the subject of music have the stamp of maturity and certainly for a practicing musician he is very outspoken. Probably the greatest money-spinner in the present-day Carnatic music world, G.N.B. is by no means anxious to pander to popular tastes. Music, we have in plenty, but it is all of a very cheap quality. This is undoubtedly due to the democratisation of art we see going on all around us, like the surge of a flood, which we are helpless in fighting against. Apart from the mechanical contrivances contributing to this (we are living in an age of gadgets) it is very disheartening to notice that artistes who supply music on the platform and are hence responsible for the growth and development of music culture, also descend to the level of playing to the gallery and thus lower the standards of taste in the art. Mr. Balasubramaniam was equally forthright in his views on musical composers. He did not agree with those who maintained that the last in composing had been done by the Trinity and that it was a sheer waste of time to attempt to produce anything that may be greater than the works of those three great masters. G.N.B. said. True, but Patnam Subramaniam Aiyar, Ramnad Srinivasa Iyengar and Muthiah Bhagavatar had composed beautiful pieces not because they felt they were greater than the Trinity but because they had the creative urge and the music world of to-day is really the better for their gifts. In the course of my talk with him I could not help feeling the artiste's pronounced partiality for Sri Tyagaraja. He said that it was not the mere repertoire of Sri Tyagaraja that had dragged him to the Saint of Tiruvayyar, but the genius of the composer in couching his works in the simplest language. Mr. Balasubramaniam added that, notwithstanding the risk in the performance-value, he had made it a point to include in his concerts Tyagaraja's less-known kritis. They may be rare but look at the abounding rakti therein. Don't you think that for this reason alone we should include them in our concerts? he asked. At this point he sang snatches of Bagayanayyain Chandrajyoti and said that this kriti was not ordinarily sung because of the difficult ghandara prayoga in it. But he had pledged to popularise it even as he had kritis like Teliyaledu Rama in Dhenuka, Ni-daya in Vasanta-bhairavi, etc.    OPEN",

A resolution was passed at the Corporation Council meeting on Thursday. Nine primary schools would be upgraded to middle schools, and 15 middle schools to high schools. A high school each in CPT Colony, Arathoon Road, N.P.Koil Street, Kilpauk and Jaffarkhanpet would be made higher secondary schools. The posts of assistant education officers would be doubled from five for better administration, officials of the Corporation said. The council also decided to appoint Certification Engineers International Limited as consultant for third party quality assurance and quality control for the project to improve micro-drains. The firm would ascertain the quality of the construction materials and supervise the works being carried out in three packages in watershed areas such as Royapuram, Otteri Nullah canal and Cooum River under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. A resolution on the work to be taken up in the Virugambakkam-Arumbakkam watershed at a cost of Rs.6.64 crore was also approved by the Council. Earlier, Opposition leader in the Council Saidai P. Ravi said the project to improve canals and stormwater drains was being carried out at a slow pace. Though work order was issued nine months ago, only a negligible length of the canals has been covered. He wanted the civic body to convene a meeting of the contractors and expedite the work. He urged the Corporation to take measures to include automobile spare-parts shops in Border Thottam in the proposal to shift the business to Auto Nagar at Appur village. Purchase of five mechanical sweepers worth Rs.2.19 crore, laying of roads for a length of 146.38 km with the government funding of Rs.60 crore and construction of concrete houses for the benefit of 230 persons under the Basic Services to the Urban Poor scheme were among the 60 resolutions passed at the meeting.

        "content": " Accidents happen everywhere But the question is: do the victims reach the nearest hospital on time. This should be the first priority. Keeping this in mind, a group of doctors roped in about 100 auto drivers from different pockets in the city and conducted an awareness workshop-cum-first-aid meet on the things to be done. Regional Transport Officer (Madurai North) N. Ravichandran inaugurated the event held at the Preeti Hospitals here. Emergencies need not necessarily be road accidents. It could be a pregnancy, a heart attack, a fire accident or a flood situation. What is expected it to rescue the victims from the spot as soon as possible to the hospital. A first-aid treatment would be a great help to the victim. This, we thought of disseminating to the auto drivers, the doctors said. The idea of involving auto drivers hit the mind for the simple reason that they are present everywhere in the city. It was not just enough to rush a patient to a nearby hospital. The cause for the emergency should be known as it would help reach the right doctor and thus save time and blood, R. Sivakumar of Preeti Hospitals said. By providing the right kind of first aid, many precious lives could be saved well within the golden hour. Trained medical practitioners may not be available at all the time or to administer first-aid on the middle of the road. Hence, as an alternative, auto drivers' who had the inclination to help victims may jump into action. M. Chidambaram, a former professor from the Government Rajaji Hospital, spoke on trauma awareness. Sharing their views, the autorickshaw drivers' thanked the doctors and said that they would be of immense help to the victims. The Transport Department officials said that autorickshaw drivers' were aware of almost every corner in the city. They can reach through the minimally travelled roads to the nearest hospitals.

        "content": " With Assembly elections being scheduled in the first half of 2011, law enforcers in the Central Zone, comprising eight districts, have begun to gear up for the elaborate exercise of providing security to ensure free and fair polling. The men in khaki have already commenced the ground work in the Zone well ahead of the announcement of the assembly polls by the Election Commission, fully aware of the fact that their task required meticulous planning and execution and putting in place necessary logistics before hand to ensure peaceful conduct of the elections. Armed with the available data on mosaic of aspects compiled during the previous elections, law enforcers have decided to fine tune them taking into account the prevailing ground level situation in every district before devising comprehensive security plans. This is the first time that the assembly elections are to be conducted in Tamil Nadu following the delimitation exercise. Besides listing out the areas which were caste and communally sensitive based on past incidents and previous experiences, police authorities say they would be re-assessing the vulnerable polling booths by ascertaining field level inputs and carrying out physical inspections. With manpower being the backbone of any bandobust measure, the existing strength in Tiruchi, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Karur, Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts falling under the Zone with 34 Sub Divisions and 201 police stations, has already been collected. The Unit Officers (Superintendent of Police in case of district and Commissioner of Police in the case of Tiruchi City) had already made the preliminary projections and requirements relating to manpower and logistics for their respective districts. The sources say the law enforcers were in the possession of election-related untoward incidents during the previous poll; the number of cases registered earlier and areas which had been identified as sensitive, hyper sensitive and politically sensitive. Stating that the ground work for the 2011 elections had already been started, the Inspector General of Police, Central Zone and Commissioner of Police (in-charge) Karan Singha expressed hope that a final shape in respect of the comprehensive plan for each district would be in place by March. Alongside launching the preliminary work, law enforcers have planned to carry out special drives to execute pending non-bailable warrants across the zone in connection with the upcoming polls. Police sources say the pending non-bailable warrants (old and new) in Tiruchi Range was over 1,000, while it was more than 1,800 in Thanjavur range.

        "content": " : It is over four years since class XI and XII syllabus of the State Board was revised, but the changes, especially in the core subjects seem to have had only a little importance and relevance for students pursuing either engineering or sciences. This is a concern that students and subject teachers have often been raising, but to little effect. Chemistry had always been a tough subject for R.N. Shahidya in school, but whatever she learnt with difficulty is of little use in the engineering programme that she is pursuing now. There is no trace of organic chemistry in engineering. Around 45 per cent of marks were for organic in class XII and we couldn't dare skip it. In fact, 90 per cent of the Chemistry that I studied in school has no relevance to what I am learning now, says the first-year electronics and engineering student of SSN College of Engineering. The same is the case with Physics and Mathematics for the students. The general complaint is there is no continuity in chapters in Mathematics in school. As regards Physics, the State Board students complain about the syllabus being voluminous, particularly topics such as light and optics. Professors and academics agree that the Higher Secondary School syllabus is vast. Some teachers say the class XI syllabus is more difficult than that of class XII. This imbalance is hampering teachers and students. In engineering we notice that a majority of students do not know their basics. That's also because teachers rush through the syllabus as it is vast and students do not learn with any logic in mind, says R. Jeyalakshmi, professor at SRM University. According to her, emphasis is more on physical and inorganic chemistry in most branches of engineering. Organic chemistry is dealt with for students pursuing biotech courses. The wider the syllabus at school, the less the depth, she says. V. Balasubramanian, Chairperson, Higher Secondary Chemistry Textbook Committee and former Head of the Department of Chemistry at Presidency College, says there was a vast difference in CBSE and State Board syllabus and the content was prepared in accordance with the NCERT. Teachers, college professor and experts were consulted before writing the book. As schools had raised concerns 20 per cent of the syllabus was reduced, says Mr. Balasubramanian. He says that in a perfect system there must be scope to revise syllabus often, say, every three or four years, as done by the CBSE and colleges. With the Uniform System of School Education being introduced for all classes from the coming academic year, schools say regular feedback and working on the suggestions is one way to ensure right balance. A senior official from the School Education Department says the Board members of the Uniform System of School Education can constitute sub-committees of subjectwise experts to review textbooks. For instance, some conceptual errors and changes are being carried out in the class VI Samacheer Kalvi' textbooks, the official added.  OPEN",

Mr. Mukherjee, who inaugurated the Northern India Chief Ministers Conclave organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry here, said when 30 per cent of our population lives below the poverty line and 26 per cent are illiterate, inclusion cannot merely be a slogan but a compelling goal. The President said the need to reverse the deceleration in growth and raise it to 8 to 9 per cent that India had recorded for most of the years in the previous decade should be taken up as a collective challenge. He called for development in the sectors of manufacturing, research and development and the agriculture sectors. The Indias economy is the sum total of its States economies. States with large economies are crucial for growth of the national economy. Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, the top five States in terms of economic size, contribute close to half the countrys GDP. Of the five economically biggest States, only Maharashtra and Gujarat grew by more than 8 per cent in 2011-12. But, there is a perceptible deceleration in these States, from the high levels of growth achieved by them in the previous two years. Among the States in Northern India, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have grown at a rate less than the average growth of the country in 2011-12. This needs to change, Mr. Mukherjee said.  OPEN",

It takes one good ball to terminate a fledgling or established innings. Kohli has remembered his lessons well. His third Test century was crafted under the guidance of Mahendra Singh Dhonis strict vigil in the middle. Kohli watched his senior partner and adapted. The vigorous touch to his batting remained curtailed but there were phases of dominance by this chirpy Delhi batsman. Kohli gives the impression of a man in a hurry. His brisk gait to the crease, a quick glance to survey the field and an easy stance is an extension of his unbridled enthusiasm that begins the moment he steps out of the dressing room. At No 5, Kohli brings welcome depth to Indias batting. The 198-run partnership between Kohli and Dhoni raised Indias hopes of saving the contest with the 24-year-old Delhi batsman, rated high for his temperament, complementing his captain adequately during a difficult phase. India may have slipped in the last session, losing four wickets to sign off at 297 for eight, but Kohlis outstanding performance matched Dhonis in substance.  OPEN",

While the brainstorming session is aimed at rejuvenating the partys rank and file for the general elections in 2014, the Telangana statehood issue and differences between Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy and PCC chief Botcha Satyanarayana might find an echo at the meeting. In a bid to mollify the Telangana leaders, the PCC chief said that he would make an open appeal to the Centre to find an early solution to the sensitive subject. Sources said there was some friction between the Chief Minister and the PCC chief after Mr. Reddy turned down a request to put off his Indiramma Baata, mass contact programme, scheduled from December 17 in Visakhapatnam district. It is understood that Mr. Reddy reportedly told the PCC chief that it would not make any difference if delegates from four constituencies in Visakhapatnam did not attend the convention. AICC general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad will participate in the convention which is expected to be attended by nearly 10,000 delegates. Besides seeking to highlight the achievements of the Centre and State on various issues such as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail and the SC/ST Sub-Plan Bills, it will also take up Benefit Transfer scheme and the increase in the cap subsidies for LPG cylinders. The need to provide special sub-plan for BCs and minorities, women empowerment, youth, irrigation, power, preparedness for the cooperative elections are other subjects slated for discussion.

The fine was levied for three months  Rs.7.78 crore for September, Rs.16.51 crore for October, and Rs.27.24 crore for November  according to a senior official of the EPDCL. He said the penalty was imposed in accordance with the order issued by the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC). The Navratna public sector unit RINL, corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, was not spared notwithstanding the special arrangement with the State government to draw more and pay the amount whenever they had a shortfall in generation from its 240 MW captive power plant. RINL has several process units and functions round-the-clock requiring uninterrupted supply of power. The Navratna company is ramping up new units set up under the project to expand capacity from 3.2 million tonnes to 6.3 million tonnes at a cost of Rs.12,500 crore. Before the expansion project, it had given surplus power generously to the State Grid. With increase in its requirement due to trial production in some of the expansion units, it is now in the process of developing a 120 MW gas-based power plant. Expansion The full expansion under the current project will take its requirement to 400 MW. RINL is credited with using modern and green technologies in captive power production. Of 400 MW, the existing captive power plant generates 240 MW by using waste heat, gas and steam. The new plant involving an investment of Rs.420 crore will use blast furnace gas as its raw material.

On Friday, the Krishi Vigyan Kendra at Sikkal commenced its demonstrations on water application through mobile sprinklers at Agara Orattur village in the district. According to R.Rajendran, Head of KVK, the Vice Chancellor of TNAU has identified a team of scientists for demonstrating the use of sprays in Cauvery delta districts including Nagapattinam under the guidance of senior-level officers. Dr.Rajendran and his team of scientists at KVK demonstrated the use of mobile sprinklers irrigation on fields severely affected by water shortage . The sprinkler irrigation method envisages just one-third water use against the conventional method . The petrol/kerosene-run pumps could cover one acre within four hours using a single spray head. The programme included spraying of KCI solution (one per cent of Potassium Chloride) for improving drought resistance in crops. According to Dr.Rajendran, TNAU has produced and supplied bacterial culture  pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophs (PPFM) as bio-fertilizer for mass spraying through KVK and research stations. The bio-fertilizer, when sprayed on the paddy crops , produces growth promoting substances that helps the crops to withstand terminal drought . PPFM is recommended at 200 ml/acre (I ml in one litre of water) and about 300 litres of PPFM has been supplied for Nagapattinam as first consignment through TNAU. Krishnamurthy, Assistant Director of Agriculture, Nagapattinam, AAOs and farmers participated in the demonstration. The Department of Agricultural Engineering, Nagapattinam, facilitated the demonstration. In extended demonstrations, Collector T.Munusamy inspected sprinkler-irrigated fields in Sangamangalam in Sikkal in Nagapattinam. The demonstrations were organised by KVK, as part of its mandate of spreading the use of sprinklers to beat the water scarcity.  OPEN",

Asked whether the event will witness the  taajposhi  (coronation) of Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Dwivedi said such words were irrelevant as it was clear to everybody that Mr. Gandhi held a very important position in the party. The Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee (RPCC) will play a supporting role in organising the event. The first two days will witness the participation of around 250 delegates while the mini-delegation on the 20th will see over 1,200 delegates, RPCC spokesperson Kuldeep Sharma told The Hindu . After holding the review meeting at a hotel here, the six AICC officials made a brief stopover at the Birla auditorium  the venue of the chintan shivir  and reviewed preparations there.

        "content": " With the Jan Kranti Party set to merge with the Bharatiya Janata Party, the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Kalyan Singh, is expected to delay his return to his parent party  owing to technical issues over his Lok Sabha membership  and is unlikely to rejoin the BJP here on January 21. Kalyan Singhs son, former Minister and JKP president Rajveer Singh, other leaders and workers alone will join the BJP at a rally to be addressed by BJP president Nitin Gadkari. According to BJP sources, Mr. Kalyan Singh could land in trouble if a petition seeking his disqualification from the House were to be made to the Lok Sabha Speaker during the merging of the parties. There was a possibility of him returning to the party fold just before the 2014 Lok Sabha election, BJP sources said. Mr. Kalyan Singh himself indicated that he was not in a hurry to return, while talking to reporters at his residence. The former BJP president, Rajnath Singh, on Saturday called on the JKPs founder-leader at his residence to wish him on his 81st birthday. Mr. Rajnath Singh, accompanied by a host of BJP leaders, including State unit chief Laxmikant Bajpai, said he had made the trip from Delhi, specially to greet Mr. Kalyan Singh on his birthday. The former BJP chief said the party had gained from his leadership and he continued to support it. Notwithstanding the timing of his return, the former BJP strongman has been interacting with senior party leaders. His meeting with Mr. Gadkari in New Delhi in December paved the way for his comeback into the saffron fold. On December 25  the birthday of the former Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee  Mr. Kalyan Singh shared the platform with BJP leaders, including Lucknow MP Lalji Tandon, at a felicitation function here. Ironically, when Mr. Singh first left the BJP in 1999, he had made Mr. Vajpayee the butt of his verbal attack. He returned to the party before the 2007 U.P. Assembly elections and led the BJPs charge as the shadow Chief Minister. The BJP was routed and Mr. Singh once again severed his links with the party and rejoined forces with old friend and ally Mulayam Singh. He even attended the Samajwadi Partys national executive in Agra and donned the red socialist cap. This time round, it was the Samajwadi Party presidents turn to face the heat in the 2009 Lok Sabha election. Muslims, angered at the union, deserted Mr. Mulayam Singh and the shift benefited the Congress. After Mr. Mulayam Singhs apology to the Muslims, Mr. Kalyan Singh ended his association with the former.

        "content": " Hitting the gym every morning, toiling for those six packs, learning dance, or walking the ramp  if aspiring actors thought that merely these would help them make a mark in the film industry they are mistaken, says ace cinematographer and filmmaker Rajiv Menon. Contrary to such beliefs, acting is not something one can eventually pick up, he says. Mindscreen Film Institute, founded by him, has put together a foundation course in acting that seeks to train aspiring actors in different aspects of acting and performance in a holistic manner. Speaking to TheHindu on Wednesday, Mr. Menon says: Cinema is seeing a transition. We see many more real characters in films and there are several opportunities for young talent. These changes bring along a need for actors to be able to take up roles that do not necessarily come from the classes they belong to. Actors will have to keenly observe life, assimilate details and reflect on how to use one's body, voice and gestures to bring out what a particular character warrants, and what the director envisions. When an actor constructs reality, it has to be riveting and entertaining. There has to be an emotional connect with the audience. The course will enable students to engage with select classical and contemporary texts, and also take classes with specialists in different fields, including K.C.Manavendranath, who is trained in Koodiyattam, Kamlesh Futnani, an aerobics instructor, Palani Murugan, an actor and dancer, Hans Kaushik, an actor and sculptor, J. Jayakumar, actor and Kalairani, an actor with a theatre and film background. Mr. Menon will also take a few lectures, covering aspects such as the role of a camera, how does one deal with a moving camera around, what happens when one dubs and when sound is recording live. At the end of the course, students could get a portfolio done and also have some video recordings of their performances made, which would be put up on the institute's website (www.mindscreen.co.in). The newly-trained actors are also likely to be featured in films made by students of other courses offered by the institute. Applicants for the acting course would be selected based on an audition, Mr. Menon said. The course, which will span two months, will begin on January 17.

        "content": " Nageswara Rao Park near Luz is a popular spot for morning-walkers. The Chess Square there, however, has proved a launch-pad for the musical journey of many a youngster. Much before the term CSR (corporate social responsibility) became an oft-flaunted word by modern companies, Sundaram Finance Ltd. of the TVS Group has been quietly doing its bit to promote Carnatic music. Catch them young, the company says; and it has been doing just that. No waiting for December to arrive to announce the ritual. The Sundaram Finance Sunday Kutcheri at the Park has been held every first Sunday, month after month, since February 2006. The idea is to offer kids in the below-15-year age group a platform to showcase their musical wares in a natural ambience shorn of mikes. Over 600 kids have performed at Chess Square since the advent of the event. Our former chairman, the late T.S. Santhanam, believed that we should always give back something to the community in which you function, says T.T. Srinivasaraghavan, Managing Director of Sundaram Finance. The mike-less concert at the park is an extension of the larger Mylapore Festival that the company has been hosting every year. Why do they hold it in Mylapore? Our roots, so to speak, are in Mylapore. Many of our depositors come from this area. In a way, Mylapore is the epicentre of Madras culture, which is steeped in music, dance, drama, et al, he points out. Kolam contest The tradition began as a kolam contest.  Kolam is intrinsic not just to Chennai but to Tamil Nadu as a whole. We like to associate, promote and preserve things that are quintessential to Chennai, points out Mr. Srinivasaraghavan. Subsequently, the kolam contest led the company to organise the Mylapore festival of art and music. The mike-less park concert was started, initially, in 2004 as a component of the larger four-day annual Mylapore festival. When Sundaram Finance began sponsoring the maintenance of Nageswara Rao Park, the concept expanded onto a larger canvas. A sub-text has been added to the mike-less park kutcheri with the TVS Group firm hosting, for the last three years, a three-day annual Navaratri Kutcheri in the park. All three components  the Mylapore Festival, the monthly Sunday concerts, and the Navaratri one  would have collectively seen over 700 kids from within and outside the country present mike-less kutcheri in the park. There have been pressures to have mikes incorporated into the event. But Sundaram Finance has stuck to its original concept for two reasons. For one, we want to recapture the times of the past. For another, we cant arrogate to ourselves the power to force every morning-walker at the park to listen to the concert, argues Mr. Srinivasaraghavan. Sound is contained within an audible distance, as we want to be sensitive to the public at large, he says. Can this be extended to other areas in the city? He is not so enthusiastic about the idea, but concedes: Our initiative can sprout similar efforts by others elsewhere. We could be a reference point or a benchmark for them. What the right hand does, the left hand shouldnt know. So saying, he asserts that the focus is on kids and kids alone.  OPEN",

        "content": " It all started in a well-planned manner by the beginning of 2012. But within a few months, Tamil Nadu got a record number of 32,000 college students who had undergone intensive training on first aid techniques. The creation of this strong student volunteer force was part of the ambitious Iyarkai Mission 2012 programme of St. John Ambulance (India)  Tamil Nadu state. The trainees include over 1,000 college students, including about 250 girls, representing four city-based colleges. The mission is to run with the theme Learning first aid to save a life. A total of 1,000 volunteers are trained in every district and certified to serve during disasters. They will receive first aid kits and identity cards to provide first aid. Dr. Vadivel Mugundhan, chairman of St. John Ambulance (India), Tamil Nadu state, launched Iyarkai Mission 2012 programme with the objective of imparting first aid training to college and school students in the beginning, and later covering the entire population. Four city colleges  Bishop Heber College, Jamal Mohamed College, K. Ramakrishnan College of Engineering, and MIET Arts and Science College  were selected for this programme. Senior first aid lecturers of St. John Ambulance from Chennai and Tiruchi were the resource persons at the training programmes. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving technique required when someone suffers heart attack or is getting drowned. Experts imparted training in CPR to the volunteers. The volunteers got tips on handling the people who have suffered fractures, stopping bleeding while shifting accident victims to hospitals, and treating the people who have suffered snake and dog bite, fire accident victims and factory accident victims. The training programme included both theory and demonstration. St. John Ambulance provided a special jacket to all the trained candidates apart from a first aid kit box. The highlight is that the names of all the trained volunteers have been registered with the collectorate. In case of natural calamities and other emergencies, the district administration will call in these volunteers to offer first aid till medical experts arrive at the scene. The volunteers during such calamities will sport a special jacket so that police, revenue officials and the public could easily identify them and offer assistance to them in rendering their service. The response from the student volunteers of all the colleges was very encouraging, says D. Ravindra Ganesan, secretary of St. John Ambulance, Tiruchi South Centre, who monitored the implementation of the project. Training to school and college teachers, who in turn will train the students, is another worthy project of St. John Ambulance on the anvil, says Mr. Ganesan. C. Sivaramalingam, lecturer in first aid, and part of the training sessions, commended the interest evinced by the student participants. Training to the student volunteers in the district has ended. To take this initiative to the next level, St. John Ambulance has partnered with Confederation of Indian Industry-Southern Region for first aid training to industrial workers. Both the organisations have signed MoU in this regard, says Mr. Ganesan. Over 15 per cent of the major disability and death can be prevented by properly trained first aid team and through this partnership, first aid knowledge will be strengthened by way of involvement of private sector, says a city-based industrial leader. With Tiruchi accounting for a large number of industrial workforce, first aid training programme will immensely benefit them, he adds.  OPEN",

They must learn to defeat the problem with confidence, said former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam at the Sesquicentennial Year Celebrations of the Stanes Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School, Coimbatore, on Saturday. Those were the qualities Sir C.V. Raman, Thomas Alva Edison, Graham Bell and many other scientists who had succeeded in life possessed. The scientists had big aim, he said and told the students that having small aim was a crime. Presenting a simple equation to the students, Mr. Kalam said that knowledge equalled creativity plus righteousness in heart plus courage. If the students had righteousness in heart, they would have beauty in character and that would bring in harmony at home. This would lead to peace in the world. He told the students that they should be remembered for an invention, a social change or something great because the world around them would try to make them just an ordinary person, like everybody else. But for them to aim high and turn big, they needed to fight hard. Mr. Kalam laid the foundation for the Sri S. Anantharamakrishnan Science Centre, the establishment of which is supported by the T. Stanes and Company Limited. A. Krishnamoorthy, Chairman, Amalgamations Group, said that the organisation was happy to be associated with the school, which had very successfully addressed the needs of the society. To impart knowledge and develop children entrusted to them into good wholesome members of the families and society was a noble task. The school was executing the task for the past several decades. The establishment of the centre on the occasion of the schools 150{+t}{+h}year celebrations signified the common heritage of the two institutions and registered the companys commendation of the schools records through the past 150 years. Mr. Krishnamoorthy also said that his participation brought to fore the memories of their common founder, Sir Robert Stanes and the long years of sustained relationship between the company and the school. Paul Sellers, Director, British Council  South India, spoke about the schools relationship with the United Kingdom. Mr. Kalam then presented the Mr. B. Thangasamy Annual Award for Best Teacher for 2011-12 to Mary E. Ninan in recognition of her outstanding service. He also gave away the Sir Robert Stanes Sesquicentennial Medal to Shreya Mervyn Kallingal of class XII A for her outstanding cultural performance and her participation in the international education exchange programme, Vashista Pawar, also of the same class, for representing India in junior division gold, V.S. Rathinavel of Class VI A for his accomplishments in the sub-junior international level chess championship and S. Natarajan, former Principal, for his dedicated services.

Legal measures On the sidelines of the conference on Saturday, he said that an area of concern for IMA was the proliferation of quacks, which affected the poorer sections of the society. The Government must bring out stringent legal measures to eradicate the problem as now anyone could set up a clinic and provide treatment. Security of doctors was also becoming an issue in recent times, he said, adding that cases of assaults on medical practitioners had come to light. The Government must bring in stringent legal provision against perpetrators of violence and the IMA was also going to constitute a crisis management committee in this regard. Expressing concern over the huge loss of lives in road accidents, he said the IMA would team up with the Government agencies in preventing accidents by educating students, police, public and the Transport Department. The IMA was also going to increase its strength of ambulances. Regarding the Centres attempts to create a uniform entrance test for medical colleges, he said that the Government must first standardise the Plus Two education across India before undertaking this initiative. Continuing medical education (CME) programmes would be implemented vigorously for all members to ensure that even the poorest of the poor had access to the latest techniques in the field.

Inaugurating the Coimbatore Economic Summit 2012, organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he said that in 2011-2012, the State Government allocated Rs.100 crore for MSMEs. This year it would be more than Rs. 150 crore and with the Central Government subsidy too, it would cross Rs. 200 crore. Coimbatore was in the forefront in getting benefits from many of these schemes. For instance, 284 people benefited from the employment guarantee scheme for the unemployed youth here last year and subsidy of Rs. 1 crore was disbursed here. This year, already 250 have applied. The State Government has taken a determined view to promote MSMEs, he said. It offered capital subsidy, reimbursement of Value Added Tax, subsidy to purchase generator sets, employment guarantee programme for unemployed youth, etc. The allocation had increased every year for the sector. The micro and small industry facilitation council meet regularly. In Coimbatore there were nearly 300 cases for the council and nearly 80 were solved last year, settling about Rs.3.5 crore. Tamil Nadu had the largest number of micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) in India. The State also had the largest number of micro enterprises. Of the total employment in the MSME sector in the country, 15 per cent was in Tamil Nadu, he said.

Anand, ENT Surgeon and Director of MCV Trust ENT Hospital in Pollachi. Three-year-old Divyas (name changed) parents were not worried when she developed a runny nose one and a half years ago. In their hometown in Dindigul, they took her to a general physician and she was given medicines several times but the nose dripping did not stop. In her case, only the right nose had this problem and the left was dry. She also did not have the other cardinal symptoms of sneezing and nose block. She also developed a severe night cough, which was later found to be caused by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flooding the throat at night. Initially, the cough never responded to any of the medicines prescribed. Divya was then referred to a paediatrician and an ENT specialist. The specialist diagnosed the case as a CSF leak. The fluid dripped from the nose as if a tap were opened. She was lucky not to have got meningitis or brain fever. Tests revealed that the leak was from the front part of the skull base, caused by a defect in the bone separating the nose from the brain. The coverings of the brain (meninges) get drawn down like a cows udder into the nose by the respiratory forces and ultimately the tip of the udder breaks with a leak of CSF into the nose, Dr. Anand explained. Until 15 years ago this condition and its treatment was largely the domain of neurosurgeons who opened the skull from the top (craniotomy) and sealed the defect. This came with the risk of significant morbidity by brain retraction and total loss of sense of smell. The advent of nasal endoscopes enabled endoscopic closure of the defect by ENT and skull base surgeons, Dr. Anand said. Prior to Divya, the youngest patient we have had so far was an eight-year-old boy who had a CSF leak caused by an accident. The leaks caused by accidents usually healed in two to three months with medical treatment, and rarely needed surgery. But, the leaks that started spontaneously (90 per cent of cases were so) required additional testing for the condition of benign intracranial hypertension, which was far too common than initially thought.

The university proposes to double from 15 to 30 the number of colleges offering community programmes, said K. Karunakaran, Vice-Chancellor, at a press meet in the city on Friday. The colleges would offer courses in welding, masonry, cell phone repairing, machinist, etc. to unemployed and underemployed people to make them semi-skilled and skilled. Those who had completed Class VIII or X, depending on the trade, would be eligible for admission. The decision to double the number of institutions offering community programmes was based on suggestions from the Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudy, the Vice-Chancellor said and added that the University Syndicate had also accorded approval for the same. In yet another initiative to connect with villages, the university would embark on a project to provide science and technology-based solutions. The university will begin START (Science and Technology Application in Rural Territory) project in villages. The Syndicate has approved of the project and State Government funding is expected, Mr. Karunakaran said. Further narrating the efforts the institution has taken to improve education quality, he said that the university had partnered with ICICI Bank for diploma programmes in banking. Faculty from the bank would offer courses and that would be more practical than theoretical. Likewise, the technical university had increased the intake of people for research programmes. We received around 900 applications this year for Ph.D. and, after screening, nearly 700 candidates were admitted. Next year too the university would like to take in a similar number, he said. The effort is aimed at addressing the manpower needs of engineering colleges with an eye of quality. The university had also attempted to remove the anomalies that existed in grading students. A committee of faculty and heads of engineering institutions met last week and suggested a change in the way marks were computed. The proposal was subject to Academic Council approval, Mr. Karunakaran said and added that if the change was to come through more than 7,000 of the 18,000 university students would stand to benefit. He also said that a proposal for starting a constituent college of the Anna University of Technology, Coimbatore, in Udhagamandalam had been submitted to the government. The university's academic calendar had been made public on its website and after consultations with the students and faculty would be finalised. The Vice-Chancellor also thanked the Bharathiar University Vice-Chancellor, C. Swaminathan, for his role in allotting land for the Anna University of Technology.

He said it was a legitimate contract and described the termination as unprecedented. The consortium consists of GMR Group and Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad. The issue of compensation was expected to figure during the proposed summit on 20 years of excellent ties between India and ASEAN nations to be held at New Delhi soon. Expressing scepticism of getting back the contract, he said Malaysia conveyed its displeasure over the termination. Asked about the lesson learnt from the incident, he stressed the need to be more careful . Meanwhile, the final round of negotiations for entering into an agreement on services and investments between ASEAN nations and India concluded at Jakarta on Saturday. He expected some more progress to be made during the Delhi summit and the agreement to be concluded by early next year. Mr. Mustapa said that he had interacted with captains of industry and invited them to invest in Malaysia. He said Malaysia had entered into an economic cooperation agreement with India and the two-way trade touched $12.5 billion in 2011 and it was expected to reach $15 billion by 2015.

In his presidential address, Tourism Minister A.P. Anilkumar said the GKSF was becoming more popular every year thanks to the support of the trading community and the public. In the course of a few years, it would become one of the biggest shopping events in the world, he hoped. Agriculture Minister K.P. Mohanan; MLAs A.P. Abdullakutty, Sunny Joseph and T.V. Rajesh; actor Dileep; District Collector Rathan Kelkar; district panchayat president K.A. Sarala; and municipal chairperson M.C. Sreeja were among those who attended the opening ceremony. The inaugural function was followed by an entertainment show, which included musical and dance programmes.  OPEN",

More than 12 hours before applications were to be given, a long queue formed outside St. Josephs Boys School on Museum Road, while people started milling around at the Sophia High School in High Grounds by around 9 p.m. While application forms will be given between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Saturday at Josephs, they will be handed out between noon and 3 p.m. till Wednesday at Sophias. Armed with bedsheets, towels, short eats and some even their dinner, people occupied the footpath as queues swelled by the hour. I want to put my daughter in a good school that is also closer to my residence. I dont mind standing or sitting on the footpath throughout the night, said Chandra Kumar, who lives at Palace Guttahalli and is a software engineer with a leading company in ITPB. Mr. Kumar, who was keen that his daughter gets a seat at Sophias, said he had taken leave for his paternal duty. He said though he was standing in the queue overnight, the fate of the admission would be known only in April. It also depended on his daughters performance at the interview, he added. Outside the gate of St. Josephs Boys School, the crowd was bigger as application forms would be given only on Saturday, unlike at Sophia.  They waited to snap up scarce admission forms  OPEN",

I am given to understand that the Chief Minister had given a commitment to the Assembly after the elections last year that an additional Rs 5 crore would be given to the biennale. If that is the case, he should deliver on the promise, Mr. Sundaram, whose installation on the lost port of Muziris has been a huge draw at the biennale, told The Hindu . The State, during the previous government, had supported the Kochi Biennale Foundation with a grant of Rs. 5 crore. Mr. Sundaram said there was a need for a signature campaign to put full pressure on the State government so that the biennale was given additional funds to tide over its serious financial hurdles. The new financial support to the biennale will not only help the current edition, but will create a base for the next biennale, he added. Earlier, delivering the keynote address at a two-day symposium attended by artists, art students and art historians, art critic Ranjit Hoskote said the first Indian biennale was a dream that was contested along the way. It all started from pepper, which is a strange metaphor, Mr. Hoskote said referring to the ancient Spice Route from then Muziris to Venice and beyond.

They demanded that the government stop appointing anganwadi workers and assistants on the basis of monthly honorarium and regularise their services as group C and D employees with a minimum salary of Rs. 10,000. They added that till the government took a final decision on regularising their services, the honorarium amount should be enhanced. The federation members said that anganwadi workers and assistants were on a par with other government employees but they had to depend on an honorarium for the entire time period that they worked. Moreover, the government made them do other work also. In future, they should not be engaged for any work other than what pertained to the Department of Women and Child Development, they said. Their other demands included issuing BPL cards to the anganwadi staff, extending ESI and PF facilities, immediate release of honorarium to workers of mini anganwadis and appointment of assistants in mini anganwadis. The federation also opposed passing on the responsibility of supervising the anganwadis to private firms or non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

Bhardwaj, who have been locked in a war of words, if their meeting on Friday is anything go to by. The Chief Minister, who met the Governor at Raj Bhavan on Friday, told presspersons later that he had a free and frank discussion on all development issues. There is no need to attribute any particular motive to the meeting, Mr. Yeddyurappa said. He described Friday's meeting as a courtesy call, in which he also invited Mr. Bhardwaj to address the joint sitting of the State Legislature on January 6. Mr. Yeddyurappa said he would meet the Governor once in 15 days as he had announced earlier and there was no room for rift or disagreement. The Governor had the freedom to offer suggestions, he added. Interestingly, on Thursday, senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley had met Mr. Bhardwaj in an apparent effort to smoothen the relationship. The turn of events gain significance in the backdrop of the history of friction between the Governor and the State Government. At one point, the Chief Minister had even said that he would write to the President on the Governor's interference in the State's affairs. This had followed Mr. Bhardwaj openly criticising the Chief Minister for not providing a true picture of land allotment allegations against him and not taking action against mining barons and ministers, the Reddy brothers and B. Sriramulu, over alleged illegal mining. The Governor had written two letters to Mr. Yeddyurappa on these issues and was not unhappy with the response.  OPEN",

After a little dip, prices have skyrocketed yet again, touching Rs. 66 a kg in Hopcoms outlets in the city on Friday. While medium quality onions sold by pushcart vendors are cheaper (between Rs. 35 and Rs. 40), they are Rs. 60 in vegetable shops in residential areas. Another month Onions, which had peaked to Rs. 85 per kg, dropped to Rs. 45 to Rs. 50 per kg last week. Sources in Hopcoms told The Hindu on Friday that the prices may spiral further and the trend is likely to continue for at least one more month. According to our reports from traders and Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), there may be some fluctuations in between, but the prices are not likely to stabilise in the next one month, they said. Retail chains cheaper Tomatoes, which had gone the onion way in the last few days, showed signs of stabilising on Friday with Hopcoms price hovering at Rs. 41 per kg. They were cheaper in retail chains such as Reliance, Heritage Fresh and Safal  in the range of Rs. 32 and Rs. 36 per kg. However, neighbourhood shops were charging Rs. 50 per kg. Tomato Tomato prices had spiralled in the last one week, peaking at a whopping Rs. 60 a kg. Tomato usually goes up by 20 per cent in December but this time it reached a never-before-high mainly because of untimely rain that damaged the crop, said Hopcoms sources. Pricey vegetables Prices of other vegetables too are on the higher side compared to last year. The rise is in the range of 20 per cent to 30 per cent this season, sources said. Almost untouchable Garlic, which was Rs. 84 a kg in December last year, was Rs. 200 at Hopcoms on Friday. In neighbourhood shops, it ranged between Rs. 250 and Rs. 300 a kg. Greens in red zone The cost of leafy vegetables ranged between Rs. 24 for a kg of palak and Rs. 30 for a kg of curry leaves. While a kilogramme coriander leaves was priced at Rs. 22/Rs 24, dill leaves was Rs. 28 on Friday. Methi leaves and mint leaves ranged between Rs. 20 and Rs. 22, while spring onion was Rs. 32 a kg.

The BBMP introduced the Online Building Plan Approval system in November 2010 for sites with dimensions above 40 x 60 feet. Currently, the plan sanction process is being done both through online and manually for sites measuring up to 40 x 60 ft. This will continue only till January 31, 2011. 752 architects From February 1, all building plans will have to be submitted only online, BBMP sources told The Hindu. The civic body has 752 registered architects, who will facilitate the online submission process. BBMP sources said that the approval of building plans online is one of the reforms under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). The software has been developed by M/s. Soft Tech Engineers Pvt. Ltd. While the architects will have to procure the Pre-Development Control Room software, the plans will be verified and sanctioned by the BBMP officials with help from the Auto Development Control Room. The building bylaws and zonal regulations have already been uploaded into it. The online plan approval system was introduced in the interest of the public. The process has been simplified and is transparent. Approval process is faster and interface with officials is reduced, sources said. How it is done Under the system, residents may submit the plan along with all the relevant documents online. The Assistant Executive Engineer concerned will access the plan and begin the verification. The software will also verify if the plan is as per the bylaws and zonal regulations. If the verification is done manually, there are chances of officials missing the violations, sources said. 150 plans approved  Since November, the BBMP has approved 150 buildings plans of the total 231 submitted online. As many as 61 out of the remaining 81 plans were rejected, while 20 plans were being processed. Sources added that the new system will definitely ease burden on the civic authority.

World Bank Group president, Robert B. Zoellick, joined Finance Minister, Pranab Mukherjee and M. Shashidhar Reddy, vice-chairman, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), to witness the signing of the agreement for phase one of the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (I) (NCRMP-I), to be implemented by the NDMA. Mr. Mukherjee said the negative impact of recurrent cyclones was huge and diverts scarce resources from planned development activities into relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction. The project highlights the strides India is making in moving from a reactive to an anticipatory approach to disaster and risk management, added Mr. Zoellick. It is the first Adaptable Program Loan (APL) taken by the country and after the first phase in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, it is expected to be expanded to other States and Union Territories, according to a note issued by the Bank. The project aims to upgrade early warning and communications systems to reach vulnerable communities in coastal areas. It will also help boost the ability of local communities to respond to disasters, improve access to emergency shelters in high risk areas and strengthen disaster risk management capability at the central, state and local levels. To help the vulnerable communities in a timely and effective manner, an early warning system will be installed in about 1,740 villages - 760 in Andhra Pradesh and 980 in Orissa - within five kilometers of the coastline. The warnings customised by the State/district emergency centres will be broadcast through public address systems in the coastal villages using CDMA/GSM based Remote Public Alert and Communications Systems (R-PACS). The remotely triggered public address and alarm system will eliminate the need for 24/7 physical monitoring at the village level. The investment proposals in Andhra Pradesh include construction of about 148 multipurpose cyclone shelters to serve about 95,000 population, strengthening of almost 800 km of all-weather roads, building 22 new bridges at critical crossings, benefitting about 500,000 population and restoration/strengthening of two tidal banks of about 35km.

At the same time, they were second to none and it was evident that TAFVA came forward to extend helping hand to this people to celebrate the New Year with the people. The clothes were given to literates and illiterates from Kanyakumari to Kaliyakkavilai from the cloth bank of TAFVA. Deserted by own H.Giftson Samuel Rajan, the president of the federation, said that most of the mentally ill people from north India were left behind in Kanyakumari, a tourist spot, by their own family members. As a part of the innovative programme more than 25,000 people in the different parts of the district had already been distributed clothes. More than 500 philanthropists from various parts of the State have contributed clothes. A cross section of the people here have opined that the government should come forward to set up a rehabilitation home in district for mentally ill persons. The district administration should come forward to co-operate with the various non-governmental organisations which were indulging in providing care and support to mentally ill persons in different parts of the district for their benefit. Retired engineer Michel from Tuticorin district told presspersons that though he was well educated and rich he was deserted by his children after the death of his wife.

        "content": " The state-of-the-art new international terminal at the Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL) in Nedumbassery here will soon become a reality. The unveiling of the new terminals design, which is based on Kerala temple architecture, was done by Excise Minister K. Babu on Saturday. The facility, with a built-up area of more than 15 lakh sq ft, will be able to handle around 10 million international passengers per annum and will cater to the traffic demand up to 2025, according to the airport authorities. V.J. Kurian, Managing Director of CIAL, said the approximate cost of the new terminal would be Rs. 450 crore. CIAL is fully confident of raising necessary finances on its own to fund the project. The project has already been submitted to the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority and its clearance is expected soon, he said. Mr. Kurian said that the public could submit their comments and suggestions on the design of the new terminal. We will give due consideration to those views while finalising the engineering design. Details of the proposed design of the international terminal have been uploaded on the website of CIAL (www.cial.aero), where the public can access the design and also offer their comments. Unlike the existing terminals, the new international terminal will have two levels. The ground level will cater to arriving passengers and the upper level will handle all international departures. The terminal will have 15 parking bays with full aerobridge connectivity. An elevated approach road is also planned to connect the departure area with the main approach road. The terminal has been designed to meet the peak hour capacity of 4,000 passengers. There will be 56 check-in counters with provision for adding 28 more counters based on the traffic requirements. The departure area will have duty free shopping space of more than 10,000 sq ft, four premium lounges for first and business class passengers and food courts. Fifty immigration counters are being planned to ensure smooth immigration clearance.  The new terminals design is based on Kerala temple architecture.  OPEN",

The stall holders are delighted as enquiries and orders have already been heavy with still a few days left before the curtain comes down. Even though consumer appliance shops dominate the trade fair, furniture outlets, fitness equipment, health food, real estate promoters and security appliances also occupy prominent places. Public sector units such as Southern Railway and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) have also put up stalls. The star attraction of the fair, organisers say has been the 7,200  square feet stall of the leading exporter of granite, P. R. P. Exports, announcing the firm's entry into retail trade. This is the first time, the organisers add, that one business entity has asked for such a huge space in the trade fair. From table-chair sets to a lion bound in chains, everything has been made in granite in the stall. Even the entire flooring has been filled with granite slabs. Introducing cutting-edge technology, literally, a granite sculpture of women that had been fully carved by a new hi-tech machine has also been kept on display. While the weekdays have been seeing around 7,000 visitors, more than 16,000 were turning up on the weekends. Further, gala celebrations have also been scheduled on Friday night to welcome the New Year. The fair will conclude on January 3. While it will be open between 11 a.m. and 9.30 p.m. on weekends and on holidays, it will be open from 4 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. on other working days. The entry fee, for those above 12 years, is Rs.10.

The screening will be at Savitha theatre at 7 p.m. Directed by Bolivian filmmaker Hector Ferreiro, the film won wide acclaim at the Berlin Festival 2012. Incidentally, this is the maiden feature film by Mr. Ferreiro, who was worked as an editor for films like Aire (2008), Chiles Xalaperios (2008) and Los Pies de Leon (2007). Pacha has much relevance to the present day situation where local people resist the sale of public property to multinational giants. The film beautifully portrays the story of a street boy named Tito, in the background of the 2003 protests of Bolivian citizens against the sale of the countrys gas resources to American companies. The protest killed more than 60 people. The film, packed with powerful and poetic visuals, is in Spanish (subtitled in English) and narrates the events happening in Titos troubled days. Eventually, a mysterious woman leads him to a surrealistic world. Says Mr. Ferreiro, I am constantly discovering the world and my own self. My vision towards myself, life, art and my work is always changing. Pacha is an ideal film to kick-start a film festival in Kerala, the land of people with high political awareness.  OPEN",

More than 30 turtles were released between January and March 2012. Dr. Supraja Dharini, Chairperson, Tree Foundation, said: This is the first effort by Tree Foundation to involve the local fishing community youth and children in conservation of Ridley turtles. We create an awareness among people in the fishing community as to why the sea turtle needs protection, why all the wealth of the ocean has to be used in a sustainable wayand how as individuals one can help. The nestling season starts from January to April, during which time members patrol the beaches and protect the eggs. After a period of 45 to 50 days, the hatchlings are let into the sea, Dr. Dharini pointed out. Around 22, 850 turtles were rescued in 2012 by the foundation.  OPEN",

        "content": " Another round of power tariff hike is in the offing, this time to raise revenue in excess of 40 per cent of the existing income as the distribution companies submitted proposals to the A.P. Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) for permission to raise Rs.12,723 crore additionally from consumers. In their Aggregate Revenue Requirement (ARR) submitted to the Commission for 2013-14 here on Saturday, the Discoms projected a deficit of Rs.18,607 crore, which is unprecedented in the annals of the power sector in the State. These proposals come close on the heels of the Rs.10,000-crore burden imposed on the 2.24 crore electricity consumers in the name of fuel surcharge adjustment (FSA) over the past few months. The amount sought now is more than double the sum of Rs.4,950 crore requested by the power utilities in 2012-13. It is understood that the industry, already reeling under an unheard of power crisis, will face the brunt as the Discoms have proposed an additional levy of Rs.4,728 crore by implementing a uniform rate of Rs.7.59 a unit, irrespective of the load categories. Domestic and commercial consumers will have to shell out additional sums ranging from 10-30 per cent. A sum of Rs.3,606 crore would be collected from domestic consumers. The cumulative outcome of the additional levies in the form of FSA and the tariff hike will effectively mean almost doubling of the monthly power bills. A consumer paying Rs.1,000 now may have to shell out over Rs.1,700 a month. Also, a non-telescopic system of billing will be introduced in place of the existing telescopic method. This implies that a consumer using 500 units a month will be charged at a uniform rate for all the 500 units. The desperate measures proposed by the power utilities reflect the grave power situation which is expected to worsen in the coming days when the shortage will go up from the present 65 million units a day to 100 mu. The revenue raised through this hike is proposed to be used to purchase power, even at exorbitant rates, from outside sources. P. Rajagopal Reddy and G. Raghuma Reddy, Directors of AP Central Power Distribution Company, who led the team of Discom officials, said they had projected the ARR at Rs.49,189 crore. The deficit of Rs.18,607 crore would be due to the fact that the companies were getting only Rs.30,582 crore through the present tariff. Apart from income from the tariff hike, the government would offer a subsidy of Rs.5,882 crore to bridge the deficit. The APERC is expected to issue its tariff order by March 24 after conducting public hearings so that the new rates take effect from April 1, said M.D. Manohar Raju, APERC secretary, who received the proposals. A glance of the proposals showed that the net deficit after tariff increase, would be Rs.21 crore for AP Eastern Power Distribution Company, Visakhapatnam, indicating a different level of efficiency, while it would be around Rs.2,000 crore for other companies.

        "content": " : Karnataka Rajya Hindulida Vargagala Jagrutha Vedike president K.S. Shivaramu has sought an end to made snana (rolling on the plantain leaves on which Brahmins have partaken meal) or its modified form of ede snana (rolling on plantain leaves on which food offered to deity is kept) at Kukke Subramanya Temple. The ritual, termed castiest and scheduled to be held for three days from Sunday on the premises of the famous temple in Subramanya, symbolised the exploitation of Dalits by upper castes, said Mr. Shivaramu at a press conference here. Mr. Shivaramu, who was assaulted during the last years ritual when a group led by him staged a protest against it, said merely because the Supreme Court had stayed any modified ritual, it did not mean that the authorities of the temple, which is in the control of the Muzrai Department of the government, could resort to continue the ugly and inhuman practice. He said all facts had not been placed before the Supreme Court. He expressed the confidence that the Supreme Court would ultimately rule in favour of a ban on it once all details were submitted to it. He said a committee of the State governments Social Welfare Department had concluded that the pankti bhedha (serving food separately on the basis of caste) and untouchability were being practised in the temple. This had not been brought to the notice of the Supreme Court, he said. His forum would do the needful. He said the modification of the made snana into ede snana was done at the behest of Vishwesha Tirtha Swamiji of the Pejawar Math and a government under the control of proponents of Brahminism had accepted this. He said because of the efforts made by his group and other supporters similar practices in Tumkur and Ankola had come to an end. HC order stayed The Supreme Court has stayed the Karnataka High Court order allowing modification of the ritual made snana, practised on the premises of the Subramanya temple in Kukke in Dakshina Kannada district. Following a petition filed before the High Court by Channamalla Deskindra Mahaswami and others, the State government had proposed to allow devotees to roll over plantain leaves on which the food offered to the deity is placed. The High Court had permitted this in its order on November 9. Passing an order on Friday on an appeal filed by Adivasi Budakattu Hitarakshana Vedike Karnataka, the bench of justices D.K. Jain and Madan B. Lokur said the operation of the impugned order shall remain stayed.

The incentive fund has been mooted by the bank for the State along with a 77-km demonstration corridor from Vettu road near Kazhakuttam in the State capital to Adoor in Pathanamthitta and staffing of the Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA). The pre-appraisal mission, led by banks Senior Transport Economist Simon D. Ellis, which was in the State in December, in its report, mooted the incentive fund to support the district road safety committees. Under this, the districts will have to devise road safety schemes and seek assistance from the incentive fund. Official sources said the proposal assumed significance as the State had been witnessing high fatalities in road accidents. The mission pointed out that an agreement was needed for including the incentive fund as a component in the KSTP. On the proposed demonstration corridor, the pre-appraisal mission said the 77-km road had been surveyed for the safe road project aimed at bringing down accidents to zero. The priority should be to appoint a company to undertake detailed baseline pilot survey for the safe corridor. Pointing out that the KRSA was not fully staffed, the pre-appraisal mission suggested appointing contract staff to key positions with the support of the KSTP second phase project. A sum of Rs.110 crore has been identified for the road safety component. This includes Rs.2.50 crore for the coordination support for the KRSA, Public Works Department, and district level committees, Rs.20 crore for the incentive programme to fund district road safety project projects, and Rs.88 crore for the safe corridor project. 77-km safe corridor to bring down accidents to zeroKRSA not fully staffed, says pre-appraisal mission 77-km safe corridor to bring down accidents to zero KRSA not fully staffed, says pre-appraisal mission  OPEN",

        "content": " The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Madras Bench, has rejected the plea of a minor boy to grant family pension to him as he was born as a result of rape committed on his mother by an employee of a public sector unit. The Bench comprising its members G.Shanthappa and O.P.Sosamma said, Family pension has to be sanctioned under the Central Civil Services (CCS) (Pension) Rules. The applicant admitted that there is no specific rule in the said rules in respect of children born to a victim in a rape case. The mother of the applicant cannot be considered his wife, there is no void or voidable marriage between the woman and the employee. The family pension is applicable only for children from voidable marriage. The minor boy filed the petition before CAT Bench through his mother. The boy sought a direction to the general manager of Heavy Vehicles Factory, Avadi to apportion the service benefits of the deceased employee, S.Balakrishnan, to him. He claimed that he was the biological son of Balakrishnan, who worked as a fitter in HVF, and raped a woman while his legally wedded wife was alive. As he was born of that union, he was the son of the deceased person. This had been investigated and a DNA test by the Forensic Science Department proved that he was the biological son of Balakrishnan. The employee died in October 2012. Declining to entertain the plea of boy, the Bench said, DNA test reports cannot be considered by this tribunal to establish the legal heir relationship of the applicant with the deceased employee. The applicant has to approach the Civil Court for a declaration that he is the natural or biological son or legal representative of the deceased.   Boy claims he is biological son of worker who raped his mother  OPEN",

        "content": " M.S. Dhoni brought back memories of the late M. L. Jaisimha. Not by his batting style but the mode of dismissal. Jai was run out on 99 against Pakistan five decades ago. Dhoni repeated the act in a session that saw England restore its position against an improved Indian response on the third day of the fourth Test here on Saturday. Conviction returned to Indian batting with Dhoni and century-maker Virat Kohli bringing cheers with their committed show. England toiled hard and the Indian batsmen came to terms with their responsibility, realising part of their potential to emerge on even terms as the final Test entered a vital phase. Third century Kohlis third Test century and Dhonis knock gave India the strength to defy the English attack which suffered in the absence of adequate support for James Anderson. With Steven Finn missing the burden hampered Anderson since Tim Bresnan proved a weak replacement. The Indian batsmen needed this relief, temporary though, since Anderson returned at the fag end to pick up a wicket. Graeme Swann claimed the other two. The buzz this morning was infectious as fans came in large numbers to motivate the Indian pair in its battle of survival. Attrition marked the contest even though England was guilty of slackness in its attack. Anderson was a shadow of his aggressive self and Bresnan and Monty Panesar ineffective. If India, resuming at 87 for four, finished the day at 297 for eight, the credit should go to Dhoni and Kohli, who contributed with a remarkably fresh approach after a dismal run in the last two Tests at Mumbai and Kolkata. Youth and experience combined to bring tenacity to the Indian camp which was so demoralised after the early success that England had achieved on the second day. The pace of cricket was slow but understandable. The pressure was on India and doubly more on Dhoni and Kohli. Their run-famine had exposed the middle-orders brittleness but it had to end at some point. It ended on a pitch that aided their efforts. The ball did nothing even as England tried everything possible to tighten its grip on the match. Dhoni and Kohli stood up with the kind of discipline expected of players of their calibre. Indias batting today was far more purposeful and the confidence came from the fact that England was not at its best. True, four early wickets had placed India under immense pressure but England was unable to maintain the same intensity on the third day. To the visitors shock the pitch had eased out and the ball came on to the bat nicely. Not to suggest the batsmen could take their chances. They had to remain circumspect and yet look to score. Kohli revels in such situations and Dhoni too grabbed the opportunity. They displayed contrasting batting style. Kohli was sure of what he wanted to do and backed himself to play a few shots even in the formative stage of the innings. Dhoni was tentative but determined. It would be unfair to suggest he was batting to save his place in the team but he certainly had a reputation to protect. He had talked of leading from the front and he lived up to his word. England made its intentions known early when an attacking field greeted Kohli and Dhoni. A slip, silly point, point, silly mid-off, cover and mid-off was the temptation to invite the two batsmen take the liberty of exploring the on side. Compulsive stroke-players both, Dhoni and Kohli frustrated the English attack by opting to grind. A difficult task it was but in keeping with their resolve. Gradually the fielders were scattered and the Indian batsmen, having identified their target, achieved it before losing the plot in the last session. Dhonis footwork was minimal yet certain. His back-lift was curtailed but earned great returns. Kohli, bat twirling in his hands and feet dancing, grew in stature. Runs did not come in a canter but they came at a slow pace. Once he had gauged the pitch and the attack, Kohli indulged in the company of Dhoni, who would have notched up his sixth Test century. Their fifth-wicket stand of 198 runs in 507 balls gave the Indian batting its character. Having defied England in the first two sessions  59 runs in the first and 81 in the second  India lost four wickets in the final 14 overs. Kohlis vigil was terminated by Swann while Ravindra Jadeja never promised. Dhoni took on Alastair Cook but failed to beat his throw and his scamper for the 100th run was transformed into a trudge back to the dressing room. Piyush Chawla was foxed by the turn, something alien when he had bowled. It was an intense day of cricket that culminated under floodlights.  OPEN",

I was really eager to do well in this series so I probably got a little too desperate to score runs and that is not good for a batsman. You need to be desperate, you need to be hungry, but you cant get too desperate and start putting pressure on yourself. I am really pleased to have got this hundred, said Kohli. Conceding the situation was challenging for him and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Kohli added, It was a slow wicket, not easy to get the ball away. I had to show some patience and I just thought of applying myself and not think of anything else, just play six balls at a time, one over at a time, that is what we decided out in the middle. It was all about showing patience and just watching the ball and reacting to it rather than thinking about what we are going to be at the end of the day or the end of the session. Reflecting on the series, Kohli observed, I was waiting for this one innings. I never doubted myself, never thought about what people were saying. I have always believed in my abilities. I worked hard for the last one month. You cant keep performing in every series or every match, these ups and downs happen but you need to stay positive and have the same mindset when you do well and when you dont do well. Kohli shared his anguish with Dhoni at the latter getting run out on 99. It was disappointing because he had worked hard the whole day. It was something very good for an attacking player to calm down so much and actually fight it out the whole day. He deserved a hundred and it was sad to see him get run out on 99. On the state of the pitch, Kohli concluded, I think it was the same. It was just that this is a kind of wicket where you need to show patience and that is what we decided. The wicket hasnt changed much but I think the cracks are opening up slowly so you might see a completely different wicket tomorrow. The spinners might come into play a bit more.  OPEN",

Many residents of Kochi, domestic and foreign tourists made a beeline to these destinations and also hotels, clubs, parks etc., to partake in the celebrations. Many others headed off to homes of friends and relatives to ring in 2011, despite traffic snarls playing spoilsport. As usual, Fort Kochi turned to the endearing hub for revelers, especially youth. They turned out in large numbers to witness the Burning of the Papa', a crowd-pulling event. The police were present at strategic locales across the city, breath analyzer in hand, to prevent drunken driving. The annual gajamela' at the Cherai beach drew less than normal crowds, what with seven elephants on display instead of the around a dozen that is usual.

The numerous foreign tourists who had turned up to witness the festivities captured on camera the all-decked-up elephants from different angles. Kites of different types flew around the dusky sky, adding to the charm of the beach.

The residents said the State government had sanctioned special grants of Rs. 100 crore twice to the BCC to take up development works in the city. Subsequently, the BCC planned to construct a double road up to APMC main gate. But work was stopped after constructing the road up to Sangameshwar Circle (from Laxmi Complex in Sadashiv Nagar), thanks to certain politicians. Several memorandums had been submitted to the BCC and Deputy Commissioner to draw their attention towards the problems being faced by the traders, transporters and local residents but to no avail. Even the instructions of the Urban Development Minister was not taken seriously, the residents said. They urged the BCC Commissioner to take up road-widening work with proper recarpeting up to the APMC main gate to enable smooth movement of traffic. Proper drainage pipes had to be laid and electrification had to be done, they added.  OPEN",

Purandeswari on Saturday called for allaying fears over blood donation and said it should be viewed as a duty rather than a service to society. She was addressing a meeting at Andhra University Convocation Hall after inaugurating a mega blood donation camp organised by Symbiosys Technologies, Sahaya, a voluntary organisation of students and AU NSS unit. At a similar camp last year, a record was set by collecting 555 blood units. KGH, A.S. Raja, Red Cross, Rotary and Lions blood banks coordinated the programme. Ms. Purandeswari expressed concern over high infant and maternal mortality rate in India and the poor record of haemoglobin count among women and called for a massive awareness drive to improve red cell production. She said there was wrong notion among a large section of population that blood donation would make a person weak. They should know that regular blood donation is good for health. People donating 100 times are also leading a normal life. This message should reach one and all, she noted. She said even registration of a person as a voluntary donor and opting for blood transfusion live to a recipient would also go a long way in solving the shortage of blood. The Minister later distributed mementos to the premier blood banks in the city for their self-less service and certificates to those, who donated blood several times and complimented the organisers for their initiative. Among others, who received certificates for regularly donating blood included Ganta Rajendra Prasad (100 times), V. Johar (81), G. Bangar Raju (78), P.V. Ramana Murthy (70), Y. Srinivasa Rao (56), D.V. Anil Kumar (55), G.R. Gupta, M.V.N.S. Swamy, K.L.V. Krishna Rao (50 each), Yethi Raju (40), Vidya Viswanath (33) and Sandhya Gore (30). Out of little over 1,000 who registered, 444 blood units were collected. Most of the girl students were rejected for low haemoglobin count. Others were rejected for having malaria, jaundice and other illnesses in recent past, high sugar level and not attaining the age of 18 years. Symbiosys Technologies CEO Naresh Kumar, Sahaya president M.V.N. Varma, coordinator Rajiv Thakur and others were present.

Figures released by the Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) for the period show that medium and heavy commercial vehicles saw a de-growth of 16.34 per cent. Amid the despair in the M&HCV segment, the light commercial vehicle (LCV) segment continues to grow. The LCV and small CV segment vehicles are required for first mile and last mile connectivity, and will grow despite the slowdown, R. C. Maheshwari, President, Commercial Vehicles Business, Bajaj Auto, told The Hindu . He said that while the four-wheeler LCV segment was growing well, three-wheeler LCV sales were stable. In November 2012, four-wheeler LCV sales grew 9 per cent while three-wheeler LCV sales grew more than 20 per cent with the passenger segment growing 25 per cent and goods carrier segment growing 3 per cent, according to SIAM. SIAM figures show M&HCV sales declined by 33 per cent in November 2012. Surjit Arora, automobile analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher, a broking firm, said, the M&HCV segment is impacted because there is less movement of heavy cargo with sectors such as mining being slack. Small fleet operators accounting for 70 per cent of the industry have postponed new purchases despite discounts being offered.  OPEN",

In a move that could enhance the intake of students in technical colleges, including the engineering, colleges substantially, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has allowed an increase in the number of seats from 40-60 to provide for larger number of seats and optimisation of resources without having to set up new institutions in the area. Up to now, different programmes  one each  were allowed to be integrated into a single campus so that resources could be shared. Now, this facility has been extended to accommodate more than one college in same stream on a single campus. All companies or corporate houses registered as non-profit entities under section 25 of the Company's Act, 1956 can set up technical institutions but no joint ventures would be allowed in such cases. As of now, only registered trusts and societies could set up educational institutions. Public-private partnership will be permitted for setting up technical institutions or institutions can be established under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) system. These schemes will be allowed in 241 districts where currently no AICTE-approved institution exists, Union Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal told journalists here. To make technical education more inclusive, the AICTE has made the tuition fee waiver scheme mandatory up to 5 per cent for all institutions as against 10 per cent earlier which was voluntary. Under the scheme, 10 per cent additional seats were meant for economically weaker sections where only tuition fee was waived. Vertical expansion However, the Floor Space Index (FSI) and the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) would be considered for vertical expansion. The AICTE has been making a conscious effort to facilitate the stakeholders on establishing good technical institutions. In order that a planned and coordinated development is ensured in technical education, the AICTE will implement these relaxed norms from the coming academic year, Mr. Sibal added. The new norms also allow institutions to start stand-alone post graduate courses and granting Indian degrees in campuses of Indian institutions abroad subject to local laws. Overseas campus can be set up subject to local laws and clearance by the Indian side, Mr. Sibal explained. All post graduate diploma courses will have to be of two years duration except for the executives where the duration has been fixed at 15 months. Any course less than 24 months will be treated as a certificate course. Students of Class XII vocational or technical board of any State will be allowed lateral entry to Second Year diploma programme, while students of B.Sc will be admitted to Second Year to a Degree programme, the Minister said. As part of social responsibility, the AICTE-approved institutions will also be permitted to conduct evening courses for skill development based on expertise areas possessed by the respective institutions.

India should also agree to a global ban, said the Commission, which also recommended higher compensation for victims. In its report submitted on Friday, the NHRC panel accused the government of ignoring the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) study detailing the harmful effects of the pesticide on the health and development of children in a north Kerala village. Aerial spraying of the pesticide appears to have caused neuro-behavioural disorders, congenital malformations in girls and reproductive abnormalities in boys. Following the NIOH's 2002 study, the Kerala government had forbidden the use of endosulfan, but this ban has been easily circumvented, said the NHRC report. When the Commission sent a team to Kerala for an independent investigation in November, they confirmed that medical disorders still continued in high numbers even while the relief sanctioned by the government of Kerala has made very little impact because it is meagre, irregular and sometimes siphoned off before it reaches the intended beneficiaries. At the international level, India was the only nation that voted against a worldwide ban on endosulfan at the last review meeting of the Stockholm Convention in October 2010. At that meeting the Indian government claimed that there was no scientific basis for a ban, despite the NIOH's comprehensive study showing that endosulfan had serious and long-term effects on health and environment. Since the 2002 study, 60 other nations have banned the pesticide. When it claims a lack of scientific evidence, the government of India is either being disingenuous or disowning the work of the premier institute of medical research that it has set up, said the NHRC report. Its directives to the ICMR to review its study, implies that the government finds its conclusions inconvenient. The Commission said it was deeply troubled by the implications of this stand and the consequences it already had on human rights in India and other countries to which Indian companies had exported the pesticide. Relief and rehabilitation The NHRC recommended that the government conduct a nation-wide survey of populations that have been affected by the use of endosulfan and help the State governments provide relief and long-term rehabilitation, including the establishment of a Centrally sponsored palliative care hospital in Kasaragode district of Kerala, where at least 6,000 victims live in 11 villages. The State government has been asked to pay at least Rs.5 lakh to the families of the dead and severely disabled, and Rs.3 lakh to the other disabled, with financial help from the Centre. It has been asked to ensure that the increased relief is paid regularly and completely to the victims and their families, and improve health facilities for them. The two governments have been given eight weeks to respond to the NHRC's recommendations. Government has ignored National Institute of Occupational Health study'   OPEN",

Venkatesh has said the State will go in appeal before the Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal II to undo the damage done to Andhra pradesh in reallocation of waters. Speaking to news persons here on Friday, he said the State had paid a heavy price for neglecting the irrigation projects during 1976-2000 when it was given a free hand to utilise the surplus waters. All the political parties that ruled the State during the period were party to sabotaging the interests of the State and the farmers. He said the TDP should be blamed first for installing Deve Gowda as Prime Minister who secured funds and clearances for construction of the Almatti Dam. Polavaram He criticised the political leadership for its short-sighted view saying the fighting parties gave more ammunition to neighbouring States and cited the example of Polavaram. According to Mr. T.G Venkatesh, Orissa and Maharashtra raised objections on Polavaram only after the parties within the State spoke irresponsibly. Analysing the impact of the KWDT II award, he said the State lost 250 tmcft from the surplus water pool due to the neglect. He questioned the fairness of the parties over their opposition to Rayalaseema projects where irrigation facilities were almost nil. Had the State taken up Siddeswaram project upstream of Srisailam dam, the problem would not have arisen today. With a minimum cost of Rs. 150 crore, the project could have utilised a great portion of the surplus waters. Srikrishna panel report On the Srikrishna panel, Mr. Venkatesh observed that it would be more or less like the Babri-Ayodhya temple verdict wherein a win-win situation would be created. He said all those parties and groups which represented to the Srikrishna Panel and filed their views should honour the verdict now and should also oppose democratically if they had any objections. Mr. Venkatesh said they were worried about the fate of Rayalaseema in case Telangana was granted statehood overnight. In such a situation, where should Rayalaseema go was the dilemma haunting them, he said. Mr. Venkatesh said the Rayalaseema Ikya Vedika was formed only to protect the interests of the region. Greater Rayalaseema The Vedika had represented to the Srikrishna panel to pave the way for Greater Rayalaseema if Telangana was separated.

These will be conferred on journalists who have produced effective, in-depth and relevant stories on tuberculosis and have conveyed these to a wide audience. This year, the awards will be given in two categories: English and Indian language print journalists. The two best entries in each category will receive Rs.30,000 and Rs.20,000. All entries submitted by journalists must carry a byline and must have been published in a news publication in India between January 2010 and January 2011. Stories must highlight the aspects of TB or TB-related complications sensitively and accurately. All submissions will be evaluated by an eminent panel of specialists. The awards will be presented in March. Informed and accurate journalism can have a significant impact on public understanding of tuberculosis, a crucial public health concern in India. The country bears one-fifth of the world's TB burden; this is compounded by lack of awareness of the disease and its consequences  most of all, that it is completely curable. These awards recognise outstanding reporting and commentary in print that increases the common man's knowledge and understanding of TB and multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), says Anurag Khera, Director, Corporate Affairs, Lilly India. The last date for submission of entries is January 25, 2011. To submit entries, REACH can be contacted at 9791017202, or through email reach4tb@gmail.com.

        "content": " : The Highways Department on Saturday moved in to take possession of the lands acquired for construction of the road overbridge (RoB)at Odathurai along the right bank of the Cauvery in the city. In a major eviction drive carried out amidst tight police security, earthmovers and large number of Highways Department employees were deployed to demolish about 170 tiled houses and huts in the locality. Compensation has already been paid with respect to about 90 houses on patta lands. In a few cases involving ownership disputes the money has been deposited with the court for the rightful owners to claim. This apart, there were houses on encroached lands, which were also dismantled during the day long operation. Those in the patta lands and the encroachers have been offered houses at Tamil Nadu Housing Board tenements at Nagamangalam and Ariyamangalam in the city. The action also ended the hopes of displaced families of getting alternative sites within the city. The affected families have long been campaigning to get alternative sites near Chinthamani. They had been contending that the houses offered in the outskirts of the city were too far away and moving there would affect their livelihoods and education of children. However, with the authorities rejecting their demand, most of the families had been on the look out for rented houses in the neighbourhood and some had managed to get them. Though there were no major problems during Saturdays operation, some families sought more time to move out of the place. They were pacified by police, Revenue and Highways officials. Construction of the road overbridge across the railway level crossing near the Oyamari burial ground had been stalled for over a year pending the acquisition of about 5,600 square metres of patta lands on the city side. The highways department had completed 90 per cent of the work on the other side, towards the Chennai Bypass Road, leaving the bridge incomplete. The bridge was sanctioned at a cost of Rs.28.50 crore to connect the Chinthamani area of the city with Chennai Bypass Road. Construction of the bridge would resume after shifting of utilities such as drinking water and underground drains would begin. The Highways Department is expected to complete the remaining portion of the unfinished bridge within eight to 10 months. Only after this bridge is thrown open for traffic, the Highways Department would be able to begin construction of a new bridge across the Railway line at Periyar Nagar on the Thiruvanaikovil Trunk Road already sanctioned by the government.

Be aware that your red eye may not be the conventional infectious Madras Eye, and therefore may behave differently and require different treatment. Over the last couple of years we have been seeing a number of cases of persons who come in with atypical presentations of red eye. Most of the cases turn out to be intense allergic reactions in the eye. Dust and pollution are the primary causes, Amar Agarwal of Agarwal Eye Hospitals says. Pollution levels are going up and the human eye is under attack, he adds. While riding, driving, or even walking outside, the eye comes into contact with these dust and soot particles. The allergic reaction causes itching, a prickling sensation in the eye, inflammation within the eye, watery discharge, and light sensitivity. Every one reacts differently to allergens, in fact, each eye can behave differently. No standardised process  There is no standardised process for the way an allergen can affect someone or even how intensely the body reacts, Radhakrishnan, visiting professor of Ophthalmology, Sri Ramachandra University explains. These allergens are also likely to affect the ear-nose-throat and lungs. Every red eye, in Chennai, is erroneously seen as infective conjunctivitis. Consequently, people do not bother seeing the ophthalmologist; instead they self medicate or get over the counter drugs on the recommendation of a pharmacist, Dr. Amar says. But this allergic reaction requires different medication than is used for Madras Eye. What we are noticing is that this is similar to a condition called Spring Catarrh caused by pollutants in early Summer or Spring, points out Mohan Rajan of Rajan Eye Care Hospital. Added to the increase in pollution is dry eye syndrome caused by excessive computer usage, a causative factor surely, and it also exacerbates any allergic reaction. It does not last for long, and can be successfully treated. However, the allergies are prone to recur, especially if you do not take precautions, he says. Wearing quality shades while going out, is one way of preventing repeat allergies. Do not buy dark glasses from any street vendor, cautions Dr. Amar. Controlling dryness of the eye can also help, Dr. Rajan offers as advice.  OPEN",

Sadashiva Commission. Founder-president of the samiti N. Murthy told presspersons here on Saturday that the findings of the commission were fair and helped the untouchable castes in the Scheduled Castes list in getting their due share of reservation. Criticism Criticising the BJP government for not accepting the commissions recommendations and placing it before the Cabinet before its forwarded to the Centre for implementation, Mr. Murthy said the Ministers belonging to the touchable castes in the Scheduled Castes list in the Cabinet, led by Health and Family Welfare Minister Arvind Limbavali, were preventing it. Also, he alleged that Mr. Limbavali was responsible for the lathi-charge on Madiga Dandora activists, who were staging a peaceful protest outside the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Belgaum during the winter session. He wanted to silence the voices demanding implementation of the commissions recommendations, he alleged. Mr. Murthy said that, for long, the untouchables among the Scheduled Castes were denied their due share in reservation, which had been proven through facts in the commissions findings. He demanded that the Centre increase the quota of reservation for Scheduled Castes from the existing 15 to 25 per cent. Mr. Murthy demanded that the government amend the relevant Acts to provide reservation to Scheduled Castes in private sector industries. Demanding implementation of the commissions recommendations and action against the police officials responsible for the lathi-charge on the Madiga Horata Samiti members in Belgaum, the samiti would hold a rally in Bangalore on January 16. On the same day, the official residence of Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar and the Vidhana Soudha would be picketed. Bangalore chalo Bidar Special Correspondent reports: The Dalit Sangharsh Samiti (N. Murthy faction) will organise a Bangalore chalo on January 16 to demand implementation of the Sadashiva commission recommendations on the internal reservation policy. Till now, the benefits of reservation were not properly distributed among the 101 communities on the list of Scheduled Castes. The commission recommends a formula to set right such anomalies. The report was submitted to the government seven months ago. There have been 14 Cabinet meetings since, but the government has not decided on implementing it. That is because there is opposition to the report from Ministers like Arvind Limbavali and Shivaraj Tangadagi, N. Murthy, president, said. He demanded a judicial probe into the lathi-charge against DSS activists who were protesting outside the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Belgaum, demanding the implementation of the report.

Prof. Savadatti said youngsters obsession with technology was hampering the growth of basic sciences. No technological advancement can be achieved without the help of physics, chemistry and bio-science, he said. Prof. Savadatti pointed out that the researches being taken up worldwide were in physics, chemistry and mathematics. However, youngsters here were interested only in information science and related technologies, he said. Prof. Savadatti said a doctor could not finish his duties without physics, chemistry and biology and all researches in the medical field were being carried out by students of bio-sciences. Pointing out that marks were not the criteria for intelligence, he said that they were just gatepass to higher studies and research. Vice-president of Karnataka Rajya Vijnana Parishat C.

Mr. Rao said the absence of employment opportunities and infrastructure in smaller cities and villages had resulted in large-scale migration. All our planning, he added, was urban-centric, including the setting up of universities and educational institutions. On the other hand, loopholes in the laws on land acquisition and faulty zoning regulations had resulted in only land mafia reaping benefits in big cities, said Justice Rao.

Moving a resolution in this regard at the municipal council meeting here on Friday, he said work would be taken up at an estimate of Rs.5.48 crore to be shared equally by the municipality and a private firm which would execute it. He explained that LED lamps would bring about economy in consumption charge. Presently, the municipality incurred a huge expenditure of Rs.36 lakh every year towards power consumption charge and spent Rs.11.50 lakh every year towards maintenance and repair works. The LED lamps would ensure curtailment in expenditure on power consumption by about 32 per cent of the present expenditure. About 6,328 tube lights would be replaced by LED lamps. He also said that it has been planned to construct minor culverts in 18 wards. From out of the MLA constituency area development fund, mini tanks would be set up in wards in the town, each at an estimate of Rs.1.34 lakh. M.

        "content": " G.N. Nagaraj, secretariat member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has suspected that large-scale irregularities and corruption might have taken place in the award of contract to Alsthom India Ltd., of foreign origin, which has been reportedly blacklisted by the World Bank, for setting up a thermal plant near Bidadi in Ramanagaram district. Condemning the decision of the government in this regard, Mr. Nagaraj said that Energy Minister Shobha Karandlaje and other top-level officials might be involved in awarding the contract to a foreign company, even though Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL), a Union government undertaking and a pioneer in the field, had participated in the tender. Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, Mr. Nagaraj urged the State government to immediately withdraw the contract awarded to Alsthom India Ltd., and hand it over to BHEL The awarding of contract to a foreign company, despite the participation of BHEL in the tender process, prima facie gives room for suspicion. Ms. Karandlaje and top officials may be involved in all the irregularities and therefore, the contract should be immediately cancelled, he reiterated. To a question, Mr. Nagaraj said that it was a common practice to study the background of a company that has bagged a contract, before entrusting any project to it. It is true that the company that quotes the lowest price gets the contract, but in this case, owing to suspected involvement of the Energy Minister and others, it is apprehend that the cost estimates will be revised later, which in turn, may adversely affect the interests of the State and its people, he said. Stating that the political developments within the BJP were changing by the day, he said the administrative machinery of the State had been severely affected. It appears that there is no government or governance in the State. Ministers have no control over the bureaucracy, and the administration has been severely affected, he said.

        "content": " Of late, housing finance institutions have made the Credit Information Report issued by the Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd (CIBIL) almost mandatory before they sanction loans. From the individuals point of view, apart from making you eligible for a loan, a good credit score could also help you to negotiate better interest rates. Since the risk of defaults from a high-score applicant is lower, obviously lenders would prefer to lend to them at lower rates rather than to dubious customers at higher rates. With a steady increase in non-performing assets, CIBILs credit scoring report has become an important source of information for financial institutions. The report tracks the credit life cycle of the borrower, that is, the borrowers capacity to repay the loan over the tenure. Founded in 2001, CIBIL collects borrower data from member institutions, then records and maps the borrowers repayment record. It creates a master database that is eventually shared with all its members. For example, Sushil Kumar could borrow Rs. 10 lakh for 10 years from XYZ Bank and pay his EMIs for 18 months, then start to default and finally dodge bank personnel for repayment. Technically, Kumar could approach another bank in due course for a second loan and again default. With CIBIL, this becomes difficult. Once a loan is sanctioned, the bank reports the details to CIBIL, which records the information in its database, continuously updating it. Based on this, CIBIL creates a scorecard for the borrower that it shares with members. Borrowers with poor report cards have trouble applying for future loans. Scoring high Today, the scorecard has become an integral part of loan sanctioning. With scores ranging from 300 to 900, applicants who score 700 and above in the Credit Information Report are considered reliable customers. Two things are chiefly considered: the payment history in terms of delays or defaults in EMI payments; and all outstanding loan amounts. Your total EMI outflow is set against your source of income and pending repayments. If you have applied for a loan for a similar purpose at several financial institutions, it will be considered as a negative. Frequent delays in EMI payments and bounced cheques are other negatives. Flaunting multiple credit cards in your wallet could work as a status symbol but is a negative in your credit score because it means easy access to higher cost credit. And missed card payments add to the black marks. For plus marks, a consistent repayment record of five years works better than 12-24 month old credit. A card with a higher borrowing limit also gives you higher scores. If you intend to take a long-term housing loan, avoid taking loans for every small reason. The more the loans, the higher the drain on your income, and could lead to lower scores. The scorecard has made credit appraisal and loan sanctioning faster and more efficient. The Credit Information Report can be obtained by individuals, sole proprietors, partnership firms, and limited and private limited companies. You can pay Rs. 470 to CIBIL (www.cibil.com) to get your credit scores.     Since the risk of defaults from a high-score applicant is lower, obviously lenders would prefer to lend to them at lower rates rather than to dubious customers at higher rates.  OPEN",

        "content": " It was a red-letter day in the lives of daily wage workers serving in 24 government departments, local bodies, boards and corporations when the Assembly passed the Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Bill 2012 in Belgaum on Thursday to enable regularisation of their services. When the Karnataka State Government Daily Wage Employees Union first made the demand for regularisation of services of daily wage workers in 2005, there were more than 17,000 of them on the roll and now the number has come down to around 14,000 as of the remaining some have retired and some died while in service. Union president Chandrashekhar Hiremath, who spearheaded the agitation of daily wage workers, said the 14,000 daily wage employees working in 24 government departments would be eligible to get all benefits enjoyed by the permanent staff, including pension. However, the 6,000 daily wage workers employed in urban local bodies, whose services would also be regularised, would not be eligible for pension benefits, Mr. Hiremath said. The same was the case with the daily wage employees working in boards and corporations. However, all benefits enjoyed by permanent employees working in the municipalities and boards and corporations would be extended to daily wage employees. Mr. Hiremath said the daily wage workers whose services would be regularised would also get the benefit of seniority of service from the date of entry into service. Although this provision had not been included in the Bill, which was passed in the Assembly, Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar promised to include it through an amendment on the Floor of the House following a plea by legislators. Mr. Hiremath said services of all the daily wage workers who were working since July 1, 1984 and those who had completed 10 years of service as on April 10, 2006, would be regularised.  OPEN",

        "content": " While spectator interest may have waned after Pakistan clinched the one-day international cricket series against India in Kolkata on Thursday, the visitors can hope for some crowd support at Delhi as it is the one venue where there was some demand for spectator visas allotted to Pakistani fans. Belying expectations of a rush for visas, there were very few takers for the 500 spectator visas/tickets offered to Pakistan for the first four matches. Only the last ODI in Delhi  where 1,000 tickets/visas were allotted to Pakistan  had met with enthusiasm; and that too was a touch-and-go situation as the Board for Control of Cricket in India had not sent the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) the tickets until December 25. Visa applications had to be made at least seven days in advance through designated travel agents with ticket and confirmed hotel bookings. Even for the Delhi match, the number of visa applicants remained under 400 and many may well have dropped out after the Kolkata game. In fact, when asked if reports of President Asif Ali Zardari visiting Delhi for the game were correct, Foreign Office spokesman Moazzam Khan  while maintaining that he was not aware of any such plans  quipped that not much interest was left in the match after the series was won in Kolkata. While the procedures for getting a visa to either country have always been daunting, the venues of the matches  which would entail further travel in India  appear to have been an added deterrent. Of all the venues, Delhi is the only one with direct air connections to Pakistan. Still, the rush for visas seen during the last match between the two countries in Mohali in March 2011 for the World Cup semi-final is missing this time round. Though the absence of Pakistani spectators may have dried up communication opportunities and conversation, social networking sites have opened up a new forum. Twitter and Facebook timelines during a match replicate the nail-biting and jeering/cheering on the ground. After feverishly tweeting through the first T20 match and taking pot-shots galore, newscaster Mansoor Ali Khan wrapped up with this olive branch: Just to end it up, it was all just as a sports lover cheering my team. Nothing personal. Appreciate good cricket.

        "content": " Except in Tirunelveli and Salem Corporations, there were some revisions or the other being made in the composition of wards in all the other eight Corporations in the State, for which elections are to be held shortly, said State Election Commissioner S. Ayyar here on Thursday. He was in the city to review preparatory works under way in connection with the local bodies in Madurai, Dindigul and Theni districts, in which senior officials including Collector U. Sagayam and Corporation Commissioner S. Natarajan participated. Speaking to reporters, he said that there were 10 Corporations in the State  Chennai, Madurai, Tiruchi, Coimbatore, Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, Tirupur, Erode, Vellore and Salem. Owing to expansion of the city limits in the eight corporations, some amends were being made in these Corporations. For instance, in Chennai, from 155 wards it had been increased to 200 after roping in a few municipalities, town panchayats and village panchayats from neighbouring Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts. Similarly, in Madurai, there were 72 wards, and with expansion it had risen to 100. In Tirupur and Tiruchi Corporations, it had gone up by three to four wards. For the first time, electoral rolls for the local body polls were being prepared with photo identity of voters. Based on the just concluded general Assembly elections' voter list, the draft rolls were being released by the respective Collectors. Eligible voters could physically inspect them and make necessary changes in name, address, and deletion by filling up specified forms. To a query, he said that in about two days time, the issue on reserving the post of Mayors for Corporations would be announced. For example, Madurai had a woman Mayor now and whether there would be any amends in this regard would be made known after final round of consultations. Likewise, the norms (male/female) for the municipalities/panchayats/town panchayts would also be announced, he said. Booth slips for voters would be distributed by staffs designated for the purpose. Asked to comment on the progress of the poll related works, he said that preliminary works were in full swing and almost completed.  OPEN",

        "content": " Well before a petition was sent to Jammu and Kashmir Governor Narinder Nath Vohra last week, three of the four members of the J&K Public Service Commission [PSC] had made it clear to panel chairman S.L. Bhat that they would not participate in any decision-making until the services of five temporarily-engaged persons were terminated. Hired as consultants and computer operators, these officials have, for long, been handling critical data of examinations and evaluation and allegedly faced charges of selective leakage. According to a bundle of documents provided to the Governor and accessed by The Hindu , dissident member Masood Samoon was on leave when PSC secretary T.S. Ashok Kumar fixed November 15, 2012, as the date for the commissions 10{+t}{+h}meeting. Before his departure for Haj, Mr. Samoon had levelled an unprecedented accusation on the chairmans only loyalist member, alleging that Mr. Khizar Mohammad Wani had accessed the merit list of the previous years Kashmir Combined Civil Services examination, a.k.a. Kashmir Administrative Service, far before it was revealed to other members and notified. Two other dissident members, Javed Makhdoomi and Kulbhushan Jandial, were surprised to note that approval of the results of Kashmir Civil Service (Judicial) Examination and a government-sponsored proposal to amend the Commissions rules of business and procedure were on the agenda of the November 15 meeting. Both the members wrote a joint letter to the chairman seeking postponement of the meeting until Mr. Samoons return. They demanded that the contractually-engaged officials be discharged and removed from the process of selection of the junior judges (munsiffs). Bureaucrats at the State governments Law Department are said to have played a key role in drafting the amendment to the rules, aimed at stripping the PSC members of their powers and shifting the same to the chairman. It would indeed be easier for members of the bureaucracy and politicians to run their writ in the fully autonomous and constitutionally independent multi-member commission.  OPEN",

        "content": " : Of 1,200 government schools in Tiruchi zone (consisting of 14 districts) 42 schools were recognised as best schools in their districts at an evaluation meeting organised by Department of School Education. Welfare schemes announced by the State government for school students and proper implementation of Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) system were the focus of the meeting. Jointly organised by Directorate of Elementary Education, the evaluation meeting brought face to face district elementary education officials with the upper echelons of the States education department, including Minister for School Education, N.R. Sivapathi, and School Education Secretary for the State, D. Sabitha. With nearly Rs.15,000 crore allocated by the State government, we have been able to introduce a slew of schemes targeted at improving the quality of education, said Mr. Sivapathi. The goal of such meetings, he said, was to ensure that the State received 100 per cent results in the upcoming X and XII board exams. Mr. Sivapathi concluded by saying the department of education must strive to enrol at least 100 students in every school, especially in rural areas. Referring to CCE as a system of education that encourages students to practically apply the knowledge gained at school, Ms. Sabitha announced that the system will extend to classes IX and X as well over the next two years. Todays meeting is the last in a set of meetings held across the States four zones and we have met district education officers to discuss strategies for the next academic year and address issues, she said. The 42 schools, given rolling shields, have been identified from Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Dindigul, Karur, Namakkal, Salem and Nilgiris districts. While the State can provide the students with all paraphernalia required for studying, it is they who have to earn marks and only teachers can help them do better, said Jayashree Muralidharan, Collector. This is the first time government schools have been evaluated under a variety of heads and recognised for performance. In each district, schools were graded on a 100-point scale based on their enrolment, teacher-student attendance, maintenance of infrastructure and the quality of teaching, said V. Jeyakumar, Additional Chief Education Officer, Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA). He explained the quality of schools infrastructure was judged based on toilets, availability of water supply and electricity, and cleanliness of the campus; and the quality of teaching was judged by testing students capacity to read, write, speak and understand English and Tamil and solve mathematical problems. This evaluation will henceforth be an annual feature, he added. Also present at the meeting were A. Jaya, Tiruchi Mayor, A. Mohammed Aslam, Director of SSA state project, K. Devarajan, Director of School Education, V. C. Rameswaramurugan, director of Elementary Education and M.L.A. M. Paranjothi.

With a view to going hi-tech, the party has fixed 30 CCTV cameras at vantage positions in the KPCC office and outside which beam the pictures to a big screen in the chamber of KPCC president G. Parameshwara. Some party leaders, who have taken the surveillance with a pinch of salt, said it is to keep workers at bay when the party takes important decisions pertaining to the issuing of ticket. However, Dr. Parameshwara said that this had been done as part of security and transparency, about which the security agencies had also advised the State unit. The conference hall, chambers of important office-bearers and rooms where meetings are held as well as the verandah have been fitted with cameras on January 1. In the 2008 elections, some groups, who were denied ticket by the high command, created ugly scenes both inside and outside the party office by holding dharnas. The intention of installing cameras, it is said, is to inform the high command of such incidents, so that it could take disciplinary action and bring about order in the organisation. According to sources in the unit, the visit of strangers to the office would show up on cameras as well as keeping a watch on the workers and staff, who may indulge in chit chat on the premises.

Dr. Parameshwara is also the president of the State Election Committee, which comprises senior leaders and central Ministers.

Patil, were told that the AICC president Sonia Gandhi wanted the State unit to work hard to come to power and make all preparations for elections. The elections would be held under collective leadership, he added. He announced that MLC Naseer Ahmed has been appointed as chief of the Minority Cell of the KPCC and T. Eshwar of Gadag to the Scheduled Tribe cell. He said that MLAs, including Independents, have expressed their desire to join the Congress, but their names would be announced at the right time.

        "content": " Global IT spending is projected to amount to $3.7 trillion in 2013, 4.2 per cent higher than the previous year, according to a forecast by IT research company Gartner, Inc. The forecast is based on more optimistic expectations made by Gartner since the third quarter of 2012, when it had expected IT spending to rise by only 3.8 per cent. It is significant that the projected increase is contrary to the general refrain in the industry of sluggish market conditions in the short term and medium term. Gartner analysts confirm that the increase is more apparent than real because the increase is more on account of the projected gains in the value of foreign currencies versus the dollar. When measured in constant dollars, 2013 spending growth forecast is lower, at 3.9 per cent. The forecast covers hardware, software, IT services and telecom markets. Commenting on the forecast, Richard Gordon, managing vice-president at Gartner, said, Uncertainties surrounding prospects for an upturn in global economic growth are the major retardants to IT growth. This uncertainty has caused the pessimistic business and consumer sentiment throughout the world. However, much of this uncertainty is nearing resolution, and as it does, we look for accelerated spending growth in 2013 compared to 2012, Mr. Gordon added. Not surprisingly, spending on devices, which include PCs, tablets, mobile phones and printers, is forecast to grow by significantly more than overall spending, by 6.3 per cent in 2013. This market is expected to reach $666 billion in 2013. Gartner, however, pointed out that even this had been scaled down from the earlier projection of $706 billion (growing at 7.9 per cent). Moreover, contrary to the hype about the growth of the market for devices with smaller form factors, Gartner expects the global market for devices to expand by only 4.5 per cent between 2012 and 2016. Notably, the consultancy had earlier projected this market to grow at 7.4 per cent. These reductions reflect a sharp reduction in the forecast growth in spending on PCs and tablets that is only partially offset by marginal increases in forecast growth in spending on mobile phones and printers, it observed. Mr. Gordon observed that the escalating price competition in the tablet space, especially with the dispersal of android-based devices and other low-priced options in emerging markets, has also impacted overall revenues. He observed that the fall in the average selling price of this class of devices has impacted overall global spending on not only tablets but PCs. Global enterprise software spending is forecast to total $296 billion in 2013, a 6.4 per cent increase from 2012. This segment is mainly be driven by markets such as security, storage management and customer relationship management. Gartner expects the global telecom services market to be predominately flat over the next several years. However, it expects revenue from mobile data services to compensate for the decline in revenues from fixed and mobile voice services. By 2016, Gartner forecasts that revenues from mobile data services will represent 33 per cent of the overall revenues from telecom services, up from 22 per cent in 2012.   OPEN",

        "content": " What Vyttila Junction, the biggest junction and one of the busiest in the State, does not want is yet another addition to its already chaotic traffic. The exit of private buses from the mobility hub to the Pettah-Vyttila Road had furthered the traffic woes. Now, the sudden and unauthorised U-turn taken by motorists from the track towards Pettah to enter the opposite track leading to the city just after the traffic signal has only worsened the situation. What this does is that it holds up traffic on both directions. There have been umpteen times when I got stuck at the junction despite getting the green signal just because motorists taking this U-turn of convenience blocked my way. Many of these intruding vehicles brush past the vehicles on the right lane, leaving them with scratches, said Dinesh Neelakantan, a commuter. Just about everyone from autorickshaw drivers to two-wheeler and four-wheeler drivers are guilty of this violation. The presence of an autorickshaw stand just a few meters ahead of the traffic signal along the Pettah-Vyttila Road prompts autorickshaw drivers to take the U-turn though it means they pass right across the road to enter the stand much to the chagrin of motorists proceeding in the opposite direction. The sight of autorickshaws waiting along the extreme left of the other side of the Vyttila-Pettah Road for the opportune moment to cross over diagonally to the stand is a common sight here. Shaji, an autorickshaw driver admits that autorickshaws are supposed to take the U-turn in front of the exit of the mobility hub, but justified the presence of the autorickshaw stand along such a busy stretch. This is the ideal place for us to get trips. Besides, we put slabs over the drainage and gravelled the sideways on our own for the stand, he said. Salim Kumar, who has witnessed traffic violations take place on the road in front of his duty paid shop for the past 25 years, said the police had warned motorists several times against taking the U-turn. The crossing over of vehicles right across the road in to the city-bound lane from a pay-and-park facility in the opposite direction is another reason causing traffic blocks, he said. Hermy, who runs a fitness tools shop, felt that it is for the police to regulate the traffic and stop motorists from taking a non-existent U-turn. Raju, who runs a workshop, blamed it on the police for what he saw as three-lane traffic on a single lane leading to the signal on the Pettah-Vyttila Road. In their haste to clear the traffic at the exit point of the mobility hub they allow vehicles to move along in three lanes leading to a traffic logjam at the stretch leading to the signal, he said.  \"The violation has led to traffic blocks on Vyttila Road,\" says Salim Kumar, a shopkeeper.  \"The police have to stop motorists from taking the U-turn, says Hermy, a shop owner.

The Commissioner for Food Safety Biju Prabhakar who supervised the inspections told The Hindu that the two eateries refused to comply with norms, despite two notices being issued to them a few months ago. The food safety team found that stale and non-edible food and curries were stored in the freezer at the two eateries.

Plans are also on the anvil to ensure the quality of water served in hotels and also used for cooking. A clampdown is also on the cards against the adulteration of condiments and spices, he said.

The court asked the Forest Department and the Eco Development Committees not to raise any objection to the orders passed by these executive magistrates. The court also modified its earlier order on the entry of pilgrims at night through the traditional trekking path and asked the authorities to allow pilgrim entry through the path after 6 p.m. The Bench directed the Forest Department to make sure that only reasonable and fair price was collected from the pilgrims and that they were not exploited in any way. The court directed the authorities concerned to inscribe the maximum retail price of Rs.15 on all Sabari Jalam bottles. The court directed the State government to make alternative arrangements for supplying bottled drinking water at fixed price along the traditional trekking path. The court while considering an e-mail report by the Sabarimala Special Commissioner directed the Kerala Water Authority to immediately provide water supply to the temporary health clinic at Karimala which is experiencing acute water scarcity. The court asked the police authorities to take steps to effectively control the rush of pilgrims. The Forest Department and the Police Department should act in tandem to ensure that there was safe passage of pilgrims through the traditional trekking path even after sun set, the court said.

Reports are emerging that the land where the party has launched its struggle actually changed hands during the term of the previous Left Democratic Front (LDF) government. The party had identified 150-odd acres of pokkali fields in Chariyamthuruth in Kadamakkudy panchayat as excess land and demanded that it be recovered from private parties and assigned to the landless. The party had alleged that the land was handed over to a private company in which former Indian cricketer Kapil Dev had stakes in the name of a project called Kochi Medicity. Subsequently, about 350 party activists declaring their intention to court arrest entered the plot and planted party flags as part of the State-wide launch of Bhoosamaram (agitation for land) on New Year day. The district revenue department said the land was now in the name of 11 individual shareholders. A senior revenue department official told The Hindu that the exchange of land and its transfer of registry happened during the 2009-10 period. The United Democratic Front (UDF) government came to power in May 2011. The official said the revenue department had nothing to do with the project as the department had not acquired the land for the proposed Kochi Medicity project. Striking a defiant stand, CPI(M) district secretary M.V. Govindan said it was not the transfer of land but its conversion that mattered. When was any legislation passed in this country preventing transfer of land and how would the party know when someone sells their land? The party interfered when it became clear that the land was being converted and construction planned there. We will continue to do that wherever it happens, he said. According to local residents in Kadamakkudy panchayat, the land was originally used for shrimp farming for six months and pokkali cultivation for the rest of the year. K.V. William, president in-charge of Kadamakkudy panchayat, said it is common knowledge that the transfer of land had taken place during the LDF rule. The land belonging to multiple owners, probably more than 10, was bought by the promoters one after another. A vast tract of land belonged to one of the landowners and when he sold it off the owners of the other contiguous plots were perhaps left with no other alternative, he said. Benny Behanan, a Congress MLA, said the revelation has only revealed the double standards of the Marxist party and its lack of sincerity for the causes it supports.

        "content": " The results of the comprehensive tests of drinking water samples in Gulbarga district are shocking. The water samples were taken from rural parts of the district by the Zilla Panchayat Engineering Division. According to the official report of the findings available with The Hindu here on Friday, 30.22 p.c. of the drinking water sources in Gulbarga district are contaminated. The report said that in 1,217 habitations in 220 gram panchayats in the district there are 8,549 sources of drinking water. In order to conduct tests, the authorities collected samples of drinking water from 6,442 sources. Then, tests were conducted to test for total hardness, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, and iron contents. The results revealed that of the samples from 6,442 sources, those from 1,947 sources are totally contaminated. And another aspect that was revealed was that of the 1,947 samples, 838 samples of water have higher amount of nitrate than the desired levels. And, as many as 554 samples have higher amount of fluoride. Besides this, as many as 338 samples contain total hardness which is more than the desired levels. The Ph levels in 133 samples are very high and in 43 samples chloride content is very high. During the survey, it was also found out that a large number of drinking water sources had become defunct. As many as 1,789 borewells and 318 open wells in the district, which were drinking water sources in the past, have become defunct. In Jewargi taluk, appears to be one of the worst-hit places in the district. As many as 500 samples of drinking water of the 939 samples taken from there have been found to be found to be contaminated and unfit to be used for drinking purposes. Of the 500 samples that are contaminated, in 452 samples nitrate content is high while in 12, fluoride content is very high. The survey and the tests conducted also revealed that in a large number of water samples taken from Chitapur taluk, fluoride content has been found to be more than the permissible limit. Of the 1,018 samples that were tested, 275 samples have tested positive for contamination. And, tests have shown that there is high fluoride content in 137 water samples. In Gulbarga taluk, samples were taken from 1,091 sources. As many as 338 water samples are contaminated and out of those samples, 104 have high fluoride content. Asked to comment on the issue, ZP CEO Salma Fahim admitted that drinking water sources are contaminated. She added that the zilla panchayat had taken steps to undo the damage by finding other sources of drinking water and closing the contaminated water sources. She added that steps would be taken to create more drinking water sources in affected villages.

        "content": " All arrangements have been made to hold the zilla and taluk panchayat elections in Gulbarga district on Saturday. More than 11.98 lakh voters in seven taluks of the district will exercise their franchise to elect their representatives to 155 seats in the seven taluk panchayats and 43 zilla panchayat seats in the district. The electorates will decide the fate of 189 candidates contesting in 43 seats in the zilla panchayat, and 539 candidates in the fray in 155 seats in 7 taluk panchayats in the district. The police have taken precautionary steps to ensure free and fair polling on Saturday. Out of 1,385 polling stations in the district, the election authorities have classified 249 polling stations as hypersensitive, and 401 as sensitive. And, for the first time electronic voting machines are going to be used in the panchayat raj elections in the State. The police have decided to deploy additional forces throughout the district during the polling on Saturday. Seven deputy superintendent of police, 18 circle inspectors, 82 sub-inspectors, 382 head constables, 1,436 constables and 906 home guards will be deployed in the district to maintain peace and order during polling. Analysis The elections have become a litmus test for the Congress party to re-establish its popularity among the masses after suffering serious reverses in the last Assembly elections and the two byelections in Chitapur and Gulbarga city (South) Assembly seats. While it appears to be a fight between the Congress and BJP in majority of the seats in both the taluk and zilla panchayat seats, in few pockets like Aland and Jewargi a triangular fight is on the cards between the Congress, BJP and Janata Dal (S). During the campaign to the zilla and taluk panchayat elections in the districts, there was lack of the usual zest and enthusiasm among the leaders and workers of all the political parties. The voters were also indifferent and election meetings did not draw a big crowd. Even the meetings that Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa addressed on the last day of campaigning drew a very small crowd. While local issues such as lack of basic infrastructure and failure to take up development works were not raised during the campaign, only State and national issues were discussed. While the BJP raised the 2G spectrum scam, the Congress harped on the corruption and nepotism charges being faced by Mr. Yeddyurappa and his colleagues. The alleged involvement of the Reddy brothers in the illegal mining controversy was another issue raised by the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) leaders. None of the senior leaders of all the three major contenders participated in the campaign. Except for Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa and Energy Minister Shobha Karandlaje of the BJP, and Union Minister for Labour and Employment M. Mallikarjun Kharge and the former Chief Minister N. Dharam Singh of the Congress, no other senior leader of these parties campaigned for their respective party candidates. None of the senior leaders of the JD (S) from the State participated in the campaign in the zilla and taluk panchayat elections in Gulbarga district.

        "content": " Rejection of Andhra Pradesh's contention on unutilised water by the riparian States and the demand to treat it as surplus in Krishna river by the Second Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal, headed by Justice Brijesh Kumar, is one of the major victories for Karnataka. The tribunal's decision has not only protected the unutilised share of Karnataka as per the Bachawat tribunal, but also put an end to the long-pending claim of Andhra Pradesh over the unutilised water. The tribunal upheld the right of the riparian States over the share of water allocated by the Bachawat tribunal and combined the allocation of the surplus water with the earlier allocation and gave a final order of apportioning the available water among the riparian States. Although Karnataka has reasons to feel vindicated by its stand and remain contended with the judgment, Andhra Pradesh would continue to enjoy the unutilised water apart from its share till the upper riparian States of Karnataka and Maharashtra utilise their allotted share. Of the 734 tmcft of water allocated to Karnataka by the Bachawat Tribunal, just over 500 tmcft has been utilised, and along with the unutilised share of more than 200 tmcft in the Scheme A and another 177 tmcft allotted as the share of Karnataka by the Justice Brijesh Kumar tribunal, the State has in its kitty nearly 400 tmcft of water which remained to be utilised in the next 50 years. The track history of Karnataka in utilising the available water in Krishna so far has been poor and it took 60 years for it to utilise about 500 tmcft of water in the Krishna and would be possible for them to utilise another 400 tmcft in the next 50 years as stipulated by the tribunal is a question which finds no answer. While Andhra Pradesh has been far ahead in taking up the irrigation projects to utilise the projected allocation of the surplus water, Karnataka lagged far behind in taking up fresh projects to utilise the surplus water which would be available and detailed project reports of the new projects designed to utilise the entire share of the state in Krishna are not available. The allocation to irrigation projects, particularly in the Krishna basin, does not match with the kind of allocation made by Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra in Krishna basins so far. Karnataka can feel happy about the decision of the tribunal to permit it to store water in the Alamatti Balancing Reservoir up to 524.25 metres. However, the moot point that would continue to haunt the State is its poor utilisation of the allocated share in the Krishna. But for releasing the water downstream into the river from Alamatti reservoir, the State, at least for now, can do nothing much with the additional water available due to increased storage in Alamatti till it completes all its pending projects and takes up fresh projects. Another ticklish question which would remain a bone of contention is the direction of the tribunal to Karnataka to ensure release of 8 to 10 tmcft of water during the month of June and July to Andhra Pradesh. June and July are lean months when the inflow into the river will be very less. This condition is going to be a thorn in the flesh for Karnataka in the long run, unless it challenges this in the tribunal within the stipulated period.

        "content": " Voters of Kadoli, headquarters of Kadoli Gram Panchayat, withdrew their threat to boycott zilla and taluk panchayat elections and exercised their franchise on Friday. The voters, mostly farmers, had on December 27 decided to boycott the elections to protest against the failure of the district administration and the Government to provide them relief from debts and harassment from private money lending agencies. Assurance  The decision to withdraw the threat followed an assurance from Deputy Commissioner Ekroop Caur. Ms. Caur assured the farmers that they would not be harassed by money lending agencies, and appealed them to participate in the democratic process. Therefore, we withdrew our decision, said Appasaheb Desai, farmers' leader and Belgaum taluk unit president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha-Hasiru Sene, here on Friday. Mr. Desai told The Hindu that farmers here were suffering crop loss and neglect by successive governments since more than a decade. In 1997, potato crop cultivated in Kadoli, Devagiri, Kednur, Mannikeri, Honaga and adjoining villages was destroyed due to excessive rain. Since then, they were suffering losses every year due to unfavourable weather conditions. This year, excessive rain in November came as blow to them, Mr. Desai said. Majority of the farmers had small and marginal landholdings and they were denied crop loan by nationalised banks if there were dues of loan taken by them earlier, he said. This forced many of them to knock on the doors of private moneylenders, finance societies or commission agents at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee yard for loans at exorbitant interest rates. Mr. Desai said there were at least 400 farmer families struggling to live. Most of them had debts of Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 2 lakh. Finance societies had started issuing notices and filing cases against them. Mr. Desai and other farmers said the Union Government waived farm loans to the tune of Rs. 70,000 crore across the country. However, those who had taken loans from private institutions were denied the benefit. Relief sought  The sangha had been demanding relief from both the Union and State governments for such farmers, but to no avail. This forced them take the decision of boycotting the elections. They said that like Ms. Caur, the former Deputy Commissioner had also promised them to provide them relief. The written undertaking given by finance societies that they would not pursue the matter (loan recovery) till March 31, 2011, obtained by the Deputy Commissioner at the insistence of the sangha, was nothing but a ploy to ensure that famers voted, they said.

Organised by the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Election Commission of India, the programme saw participants engaged in a discussion on segregation of waste and having an error-free electoral roll. Mayor D. Venkatesh Murthy and BBMP Commissioner Rajneesh Goel addressed citizens concerns on solid waste management, particularly garbage segregation and non-implementation of the plastic ban despite several government orders. Monthly meetings Mr. Goel assured the citizens that monthly meetings would be held between BBMP officials and RWAs at the ward-level to address problems of waste disposal, water supply and other governance issues. Each ward would get a Facebook page and regular updates and contact information of contractors would be posted. This would help bring in greater transparency and accountability in urban governance. Meenakshi Bharath, member of Solid Waste Management Round Table, urged citizens to segregate waste and compost organic wet waste. Electoral rolls Anil Kumar Jha, Chief Electoral Officer, urged RWAs and civil society members to help the Election Commission have an error-free voter list. A draft list was published on December 10 and is now open for scrutiny and corrections. Door-to-door verification will be held from December 15 to 30; and here the RWAs can help us by checking the residuary voters lists (voters who dont have EPIC), voters slips and deletion lists. Kathyayini Chamaraj from CIVIC said that registration applications must receive prompt acknowledgement from the authorities and measures need to be implemented to track these applications as they are processed.

Murugeshi, Professor at Department of Ancient History and Archaeology, MSRS College, Shirva, said on Saturday that a lingam had been found at the Ardhanarishwara Temple at Devanari in Indabettu village of Belthangady taluk in Dakshina Kannada district. In a release issued here on Saturday, Prof. Murugeshi said that the lingam found at Indabettu resembled numerous lingams of phallic nature of Indus civilization. The Indabettu lingam is about two feet in height. He said the famous iconographist T.A. Gopinath Rao had identified a Shivalinga at Gudimallam in Andra Pradesh. The Gudimallam linga, the oldest linga of South India, dates back to 2nd Century B.C. The Indabettu linga was assignable to the same period. Iconographically, Indabettu linga had similar features. Second lingam On the basis of iconography and phallic nature, Indabettu lingam is the second of its kind in South India and first of its kind both in Dakshina Kannada and Karnataka, he said. The original temple was located near the present Aradhanarishwara Temple on the top of the hill, which was known as Manju Gunda. The temple had been shifted and built in the lower portion of the hill in the recent years, according to the temple priest Ananda Bhatta. T he name of the place Manju Gunda itself suggested that the temple might had been in the control of Natha Pantha in 10th-11th Century A.D., Prof. Murugeshi said. I am thankful to Gururaj Paniyadi of Mangalore, who brought to my notice of this curious lingam and Prashantha Shetty of S.M.S. College, Brahmavar, who assisted me in field work, Prof. Murugeshi said.

He was speaking after inaugurating a national vendor development programme and seminar organised by the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Development Institute here. Mr. Nirani said the government is in touch with G.R. Gopinath promoter of Deccan Charters, and has identified six cities, including Mysore, Belgaum and Gulbarga for the purpose. Air connectivity is the key to industrial growth as it provides entrepreneurs easy access to different places within a short span of time, Mr. Nirani said. On the governments efforts to create a land bank for industries that had participated in the recent Global Investors Meet, Mr. Nirani said the government has issued final notification for acquiring about 36,000 acres of land out of 1.26 lakh acres identified for the bank. Acquisition of another 56,000 acres is in the preliminary stage, he said. He also said about 12,000 MW of power would be produced in next three years out of the agreed 18,000 MW power during the GIM. To give fillip to small-scale industries (SSI), the government is planning to raise the bar of investment for SSI classification. A proposal has been submitted to the Chief Minister to raise the bar from the present Rs. 3 crore to Rs. 15 crore so as to help investors get the benefits available to SSIs, Mr. Nirani said.

Spread over 150 acres, Pyramid Spiritual Trust is developing a grand meditation centre at Kadtal village on Hyderabad-Srisailam highway. The star attraction of the centre being 114-foot tall Maheshwara Maha Pyramid. Made of steel and concrete, this structure is the biggest pyramid in the world built exclusively to facilitate meditation, V. Lakshmana Rao, a trust member claimed. With practice and observation we have found that pyramids have great healing powers. Human body gets rejuvenated while we sleep, but the benefits that a night-long sleep bestows can be gained by just one hour of meditation under a pyramid, Mr. Rao explained. Specifications  To get the benefits of a pyramid, it has to be of exact specifications, Mr. Rao said. The Pyramid is based entirely on steel frame using about 400 tonne steel. This structure was covered with stones over which a concrete coating was applied to give it a final shape. When fully constructed, about 7,000 to 8,000 people can sit and meditate inside this structure. But while the pyramid looms majestically over the entire campus, the landscape created around it is no less impressive. The pyramid is surrounded on all sides with terraced steps covered with carpet grass and lined with ornamental shrubs. Apart from the pyramid, the campus also boasts of a humongous kitchen that can cater to more than one lakh people, canopy to accommodate about 50,000 people, a ground level water reservoir to hold eight lakh litres of water along with landscaped gardens with facilities to take up uninterrupted meditation for a longer duration. The construction is being taken up at a frantic pace to make the facilities available before December 21, when an expected 1.5 lakh spiritual seekers will converge here. Pyramid Spiritual Trust is holding its Prapancha Dhyana Maha Sabhalu from December 21 to December 31. A temporary accommodation for about 50,000 people is also being created for the event, Mr. Rao said. After this mega event, we will conduct daily meditation classes which anyone can join. The trust will provide food for both body and soul, Mr. Rao added.  OPEN",

Students trooped out on the chilly morning to explore the garden and learn the craft map reading as well. In an effort to inculcate the habit of reading maps and utilising them daily, the GeoMap Society has incorporated two modules in the quiz- Map Fun and Map Planning. In the first module, Map Fun, students were given a satellite map of the NTR Gardens and they had to locate the places indicated in the map by physically locating it on ground. The second module, Map Planning, was organised for students in senior category and involved activities like allocating budget for various projects in a locality. Taking judgements like allocating resources for public works will become easier and more productive if we use a map. We want to encourage this aspect and develop the awareness among children through this module, Major Shiva Kiran, convener of the GeoMap Society, said. By using the maps, decentralisation of resource allocation can be encouraged, he explained. Somajiguda Corporator Mahesh Yadav was the chief guest at the event and gave away prizes to the winners. Former Director of Survey of India and GeoMap president, G.S. Kumar and HMDA OSD, M.J. Akbar also participated in the event. Winners Students from DAV, BDL Bhanoor, Bhavya and Shivani won the first prize in the senior category, while Nipun and Vineet from Bhavans Sri Ramakrishna Vidyalaya and Nitya Reddy and Sai Lasya from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Jubilee Hills, won in the junior and sub-junior categories.

The seven-year-old male giraffe was shifted to the Nehru zoo from Delhi zoo in August 2009 and since then, the authorities have been trying to find a female giraffe. Finally, the efforts, though long drawn, seem to have paid dividends with Malaysian zoo agreeing to send few to the State. Animal exchange The animal exchange programme with Zoo Negara Malaysian Zoological Society has been actually entered into by Indira Gandhi Zoological Park, Visakhapatnam, under which it would get three giraffes and in return send three white tigers. Since the Malaysian zoo has agreed to provide two female and one male giraffes, one pair will be retained by the Visakhapatnam zoo while giving us a female giraffe, an official with the Nehru zoo said. Clearances sought The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has approved the animal exchange and necessary clearances were being sought from the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) apart from quarantine approvals from the Ministry of Agriculture. The necessary paper work has already been taken up and it will not be long before we get the animal, he said. Some animals at the zoo have been without a mate for quite some time and the authorities have been striving to pair them up. For the two male ostriches, the zoo has recently acquired two female ostriches from Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University. Meanwhile, the work on Small Cats Lone, an enclosure to display small cats such as Jungle Cat, Leopard Cat and Rusty Spotted Cat is expected to be completed in the next couple of weeks. The project to create a separate enclosure for these species was taken up four months agoat a cost of Rs. 9.70 lakh.  OPEN",

In eight months, the students have managed to enrol 8,217 persons as registered donors in Bangalore. Speaking about the campaign here on Friday, Amruth Charmana M., V. Subash Chandra and Eshwar Mahadevan told presspersons that 714 registered volunteers (students and working professionals) were involved in the campaign. We have been able to spread the message of organ donation to over 70,000 people in Bangalore, said Mr. Subash Chandra. Moved by patients dying while waiting for organ transplants, the founders of Good Hearted Soul realised that it was important to create awareness about organ donation. A pilot awareness campaign was conducted and over 900 youth with diverse cultural background were contacted. As many as 620 of these 900 registered themselves as organ donors, he said and added that the pilot projects success inspired them to start the campaign. Sessions on awareness were conducted directly in classrooms in engineering colleges. Heads of 25 colleges welcomed this approach and gave a written permission letter showing their support to conduct such interactions with students in classrooms, Mr. Mahadevan said. Pointing out that a thorough research on myths surrounding organ donation was done, he said that almost all holy books had a chapter/clause which directly or indirectly supported organ donation.

Conduct of camps will ensure that members gathered at a single venue enabling completion of required formalities under the supervision of the officials of the Government and banks. The RBI deputy governor addressed representatives of SHGs who converged at a national conference on community based approaches for inclusive growth here on Saturday. He, however, expressed concern that the focus of SHGs was more on microfinance and credit while savings and other aspects of banking played an equally important role. Holistic view The present orientation should change and SHGs should take a holistic view of the savings, remittances and credit aspects, he said. Asserting that the RBI guidelines stipulate opening of accounts for all members, he, however, lamented that the recovery rate in the SHG loans taken from banks was on the decline as a result of which six per cent of them categorised as non performing assets. Earlier, Mr. Chakrabarty told reporters that microfinance institutions were not mainstream channels for achieving financial inclusion as the requirements in that direction were very huge. The department concerned of the Apex bank would examine the requests by some MFIs to relax the existing cap on margin.

Rao, Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Council to the Prime Minister. Speaking to presspersons on the eve of the International Year of Chemistry here on Friday, Prof. Rao said that hydrogen-fuelled cars and artificial photosynthesis to combat carbon emissions could be some of the most important chemistry-led innovations in the coming decades. One of the most hotly-pursued challenges in chemistry is the creation of sustainable hydrogen power by splitting water molecules. What we need today is an efficient method to store this energy, in automobiles for instance, he said. Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (of which Prof. Rao is honorary president) is working towards using graphene to store hydrogen. Here hydrogen can be released using ultraviolet light, he said. He added that Ratan Tata, Chairman of the Tata Group, has invested $15 million in a start-up company in the United States which is working towards splitting hydrogen from water and storing hydrogen fuel. Despite the exciting research opportunities that chemistry presents, the subject is under-recognised in India and often taught in a restrictive manner, Prof. Rao said and added that creative teaching is the key to encouraging students to opt for the subject. Chemistry's year International Year of Chemistry (2011) coincides with the centenary of the first Nobel Prize awarded to a woman chemist, Marie Curie, for her discovery of radioactivity. The Chemical Research Society of India will organise several programmes to celebrate the International Year of Chemistry under the theme Chemistry, our life, our future, according to V. Krishnan, Chemical Research Society of India president. International Year of Chemistry will be declared open on Saturday at an event at JN Tata auditorium.  OPEN",

        "content": " Delivery of food and civil supplies through the public distribution system (PDS) in the State has been below the expectation of the people it serves. Indeed, 60 per cent of the consumers surveyed for a study on delivery of public services do not get receipts for purchases made at ration shops. A study on Social Audit of Public Service Delivery in Karnataka conducted by Public Affairs Centre (PAC), Bangalore, found that 81 per cent of households reported that ration shops were not open on all working days. Only 2 to 3 per cent of those surveyed were aware of their entitlements, the actual prices of different items, and the consumer helpline number. Officials of the Karnataka Planning Board made a presentation of the findings to Chief Minster B.S. Yeddyurappa, his Cabinet colleges and senior officials, at a high-level meeting here on Friday. Ministers R. Ashok, V. Somanna, Shobha Karandlaje, S. Suresh Kumar, B.N. Bache Gowda, and Chief Secretary S.V. Ranganath were present. It said 51 per cent of the respondents reported that the items purchased from the ration shop were not weighed properly, and 87 per cent of the respondents reported that the ration shops do not always display the stock position and the price list. Eleven per cent of the respondents reported corruption in the PDS, and 38 per cent of them were either dissatisfied or partially satisfied with the functioning of the department. A majority (87 per cent) felt that the ration shops always do not display the stock position and the price list. The average quantity of rice and wheat purchased per unit BPL cardholders works out to 3 kg and half kg of wheat against the entitlement of four kg of rice and one kg of wheat. The average quantity of rice and wheat purchased by Anthyodaya Anna Yojana card holders worked out to 25 kg of rice and half kg of wheat as against the entitlement of 29 kg of rice and six kg of wheat. While noting the positive aspects, it said the distance to the ration shop is less than a km for 76 per cent of the households. Seven public services The study covered service delivery of public transport, food and civil supplies, pension schemes, veterinary healthcare, government high schools, primary health centres and district hospitals and Nemmadi Kendras. Complete satisfaction with services ranged between 59 per cent and 91 per cent. Nemmadi Kendras, one-stop for many government services, bagged highest score while the pension scheme secured lowest score. The research revealed that bribes have been paid by 10 to 32 per cent of the people with the exception of bus service and Nemmadi Kendras. A highest proportion of bribes paid were reported in the pension scheme. Access per se is not a serious barrier in the seven public services, it said. Public transport As many as 46 per cent of the respondents reported that the current bus fares are very high and 37 per cent of them said buses are over-crowded. Greater frequency led many passengers (52 per cent) to opt for private bus service. However, one-third of the respondents were unaware of the bus timings. Pension Referring to the pension scheme, it said 31 per cent of the pensioners paid extra money, of Rs. 39 on an average, for receiving the monthly pension. Among the pensioners who obtained sanction letter during the last one year, 32 per cent of them paid extra money of Rs. 543 on an average, for getting the sanction letter, the study noted. 60 per cent of consumers do not get receipts for purchases at ration shops   Many say items purchased from ration shops are not weighed properly  OPEN",

He was speaking at the birth centenary celebrations of the late Mansur organised by the Karnataka Sangeeta Nrutya Academy and the Department of Culture here on Friday. Mr. Malimath observed that the Centre had conferred the highest award of the land on many deserving persons posthumously. It was painful for the people of the State that such an honour was not conferred on the great musician though his achievements would command such an honour. The State Government and all those concerned should recommend his name for the award, he said. He urged the State Government to establish a permanent memorial named after the late Mansur in the form annual musical concert. Chairman of the Karnataka Janapada Academy Go. Ru. Chennabasappa urged the Government to establish an international chair named after the late Mansur at a music university of the State. Cultural narrative' Speaking on the life and achievements of the late vocalist, literary critic and writer N. Manu Chakravarthy said that understanding the late Mansur's life and achievements through his personal life or eulogising his talent was not sufficient. The late musical genius should be understood through the different stances he took in the course of his sojourn with the great traditions of Hindustani music that moulded his life. To talk about him (Mansur) is also talking about the Yuga Dharma and a cultural narrative, he said. Prof. Chakravarthy observed that the late Mansur belonged to the oral tradition considering the roots of musical forms that inspired him right from his childhood.

Visvesvaraya. Talking to presspersons here on Friday, Vice-Chancellor N. Prabhu Dev said that the memorandum would be submitted during the UVCE Mega Reunion, an alumni meet on the occasion of the 93 {+r} {+d} foundation year of the college, to be held from January 1 to January 3 at the Palace Grounds here. Pointing out that Mr. Moily had recently stated that there is a proposal to establish an IIT at Muddenahalli, the birthplace of Sir M. Visvesvaraya, in Chickballapur district, Dr. Prabhu Dev said that the 93-year-old UVCE, which was the fourth engineering college of the country, deserves an IIT status as it had had many scholars. He said that UVCE's present campus at K.R. Circle can be the city campus if it is granted an IIT status and Muddenahalli can be the main campus. To a query, Dr. Prabhu Dev said there would be no difficulty in giving IIT status to UVCE even as it continued to remain in the administrative control of Bangalore University. But, the university would not mind losing administrative control of the only engineering college affiliated to it, if it comes in the way of UVCE securing the coveted IIT tag. Dr. Prabhu Dev said that there are plans to ensure that the college upgraded its facilities by 2017, when it celebrates the 100 {+t} {+h} birth anniversary. International cell The UVCE will soon have an international placement cell to assist students to get placement in foreign companies and also in those companies with which the UVCE alumni are associated. Rajeev Chamraj, Senior Director, Marketing and Business Development, Droplet Technology, U.S. and Co-founder of UVCE Foundation, said that companies such as Citrix and a few others have shown interest in recruitment from UVCE campus. Mr. Chamraj said that the purpose of the meet is to chalk out a plan for the progress to be made by the UVCE during the next 10 years and draw up another for the alumni to give back their due to the institute. The alumni meet will also chalk out strategies to prepare the present and future students of UVCE to face technology challenges of the 21 {+s} {+t} century when they come out of the college. UVCE Principal Venugopal K.R. said that at least 10 alumni of the college, including former scientific advisor to the Ministry of Defence V.K. Atre, have received Padma awards for their scholarly works and service to the country. He pointed out that UVCE is the most-preferred college for students even today.

        "content": " Less than one per cent pass the teacher eligibility test in the State, shouted one headline. Less than one per cent clear the test in the country, cautioned another, a while later. The reactions to these results were quite revealing. Many teachers, especially those above the age of 35, who appeared for the Tamil Nadu Teacher Eligibility Test, felt the youngsters attempting the exam had an unfair advantage as they were fresh out of college. However, the results of the supplementary TNTET conducted in October were quite to the contrary. According to Teachers Recruitment Board data, only 3.5 per cent of candidates in the age group of 20-25 cleared Paper I, and 1.6 in the same age group cleared paper II. While Paper I was intended for those teaching classes I to V, Paper II was for those intending to teach classes VI to VIII. This test, which was conducted a second time because of the poor results in the maiden TET, was widely acknowledged as being easier. The results raise certain uncomfortable questions about the state of teacher training. A principal of a government-aided teacher training institute was worried about how they could train B. Ed students about classroom techniques when these post-graduates were not even well-versed with the basics in their subjects. The TET was envisioned as a sort of leveller to evaluate teachers through 150 standard multiple-choice questions but it seems to have only exposed the disparity in the quality of teacher training in the State. There are over 600 teacher training institutes in the State now as against 20 government and government-aided ones, a decade ago, and most of these are self-financing. Students enquiring if we have weekend classes is definitely not a healthy trend, she said. A larger concern has to do with the goal of education itself. Is it merely a means to an end? Arent the teachers, whose merit we are now evaluating through yet another examination, (for which, they earnestly prepared using guide books, textbooks, and important questions), victims of the same marks-only education system, which policy makers are now on an overdrive to transform. How inclusive and out-of-the-box were their classrooms when they were students, and more importantly, what did they as students, seek through education? Their performance too, in a way, reflects the mindset of our education system. Learning about the complex workings of the universe, but with blinkers on. Nothing outside the time-table, and after school hours, please. Which of these questions is most likely to come in the examination? How can they ask a question that is out of portion? The role of a teacher too has changed drastically. Today, a teacher, at least in the urban space, has to battle unrealistic expectations, technology-savvy kids and hyper-parenting. A class XII teacher who wanted to teach concepts in economics through newspaper clippings, was aghast that her peers and the school offered little scope for experimenting with class XII students. In this context, is a teacher who does not score prolifically in a teacher eligibility test less equipped in a classroom than a student who does not score a 95 per cent in the board examination is to face the challenges of the real world. Should teachers dutifully shepherd students to the other side each year when the signal turns green, or should they venture into the alluring alleyways, full of wonder? Simple, is never easy.

        "content": " It is reliably learnt that the Department of Forest has finally prepared an extensive proposal to be forwarded to the government for converting the community tank at Vaagaikulam near Alwarkurichi in the district into a birds' sanctuary. After the birdwatchers and the researchers of Bangalore-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (ATREE), involved in an International Union for Conservation of Nature study of wetlands around the Kalakkad- Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in the district, happened to notice the convergence of huge number of birds  both domestic and migratory  on a community tank at Vaagaikulam, appeals from various quarters were raised for converting the tank into a birds' sanctuary. Moreover, they also started a mild campaign among the officials against the move to cut down the karuvelam' trees, all planted inside the tank under the social forestry scheme, as they were the shelter for several thousands of birds including white ibis, glossy ibis, black ibis, chestnut-tailed starlings, brahminy mynas, cotton pygmy goose, spot billed ducks, spot billed pelicans, Indian moor hen, pheasant tailed jacanas, white breasted water hen, sandpipers, gull billed terns, common kingfishers, white throated kingfisher, pied kingfisher, pied crested cuckoo, western marsh harrier, night heron, rosy pastor, red vented bulbul, open billed stork, osprey, pond heron, purple heron, cormorant, darter, egrets, little grebe, yellow wattled lapwing, yellow wagtail, barn swallow, palm swift, black headed munia, brahminy kite, brown shrike and house crow. Thanks to the efforts of the Forest Department officials here, the government has asked them to prepare a detailed report on the present status of the community tank, now the house of the birds, and to forward a proposal on the possibilities of converting it into a sanctuary, which will enable the officials to allocate increased resources for strengthening the infrastructure facilities there.  Boon to the area If the proposal is accepted, it will be a boon to the entire Vaagaikulam area as it will ensure inflow of good number of tourists round the year, said a ATREE volunteer.  OPEN",

The snowfall disrupted normal life in Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, affecting vehicular traffic and power supply. The snow in the Himachal capital brought cheer to local people and thousands of tourists who are there to ring in the New Year. It is almost after two decades that Shimla has had a snowfall around New Year. The popular Queen of Hills received 15-20 cm of snow during night while intermittent snowfall continued during the day. Adjoining resorts of Kufri, Narkanda and Kharapatthar recorded 80-100 cm of snow overnight. The Hindustan-Tibet National Highway was closed beyond Chharabra due to heavy snow, and vehicular traffic to Rampur and Jeory was being routed via Basantpur and Kingal. Manali, Solang Nallah and Palchang have had intermittent snowfall since Thursday. The Rohtang Pass (13,050 ft) received 150 cm of snow. Mid and lower areas in the hill State were lashed by intermittent rain accompanied by strong icy winds. Dharampur in Mandi district was the wettest in the region with 120 mm of rain followed by Palampur (99 mm) and Kandaghat (90 mm). The cave shrine of Vaishno Devi in Jammu & Kashmir received the season's first snowfall as pilgrims were making a beeline at the shrine for darshan on New Year Day. Around 3 to 4 feet of snow was accumulated on the Trikuta hills around the shrine. The Jammu-Srinagar national highway, the only road link between the Kashmir Valley and the rest of the country, remained closed for the second day even as the minimum temperature in Srinagar stayed around freezing point. Snow clearance operations were in progress, an official said. Over 400 people stranded inside the Jawahar Tunnel near Qazigund, the gateway town to the Valley, were evacuated by the civil administration with the assistance of the Army. The air link to the Valley was restored and all flights operated as per routine. The flights to and from Srinagar airport were cancelled on Thursday due to snowfall. Srinagar recorded a minimum of minus 0.2 degree C, while Qazigund settled at a low of minus 0.6 degree. Leh and Kargil in the Ladakh region recorded a minimum temperature of minus 7 and minus 6.2 respectively. People in the national Capital experienced a warmer morning with the minimum temperature hovering around 11 degrees. Friday's minimum was four degrees above normal. Overcast conditions have been prevailing in Delhi for the past two days with traces of rain making the weather damp. The cold conditions relented in several parts of Punjab and Haryana with the minimum temperature rising by up to 5 degrees even as rain lashed the region. Chandigarh recorded a low of 9.7 degrees, which was four notches above normal. In Punjab, Amritsar and Patiala registered minimum temperatures of 9.4 and 11, both up by 5 degrees. In Haryana, the minimum temperature in Karnal reached double digits at 11, up 4 degrees. Hisar, Ambala and Rohtak recorded 8.2, 9.3 and 9.4 respectively.

Mr. Rao said the objective of the workshop was to enhance awareness on Forward Market Trading and functioning of Commodities Futures Market among farmers and other stakeholders. Subsidy on godowns Nabard AGM N. Madhumurthy explained about the facilities available like subsidy on godowns. Informing that NABCONS had been registered as the accreditation agency by Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) for issuing accreditation certificates to warehouses and cold storages built as per specified standards, he said accredited warehouses could issue Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWRs) and banks could extend finance against these NWRs. This could help farmers seek loans from banks against NWRs and avoid distress sale of agricultural produce. He said the government had extended the benefit of interest subvention to farmers having Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) for a further period of up to six months for post-harvest storage at the same rate as available to crop loans against NWRs issued by warehouses registered with WDRs.

Talking to reporters ahead of the 23rd board meeting of SmartCity Kochi here on Friday, Fareed Abdulrahman, the CEO of Dubai-based SmartCity, hinted that the two-month period was to give the mission  by government representative M.A. Yousuf Ali to end the stalemate  a fair chance to succeed. All through the interaction, the CEO was at pains to describe Mr. Ali as a State government representative and not a mediator. A mediator has to be unanimously nominated by both parties. SmartCity had no part in the perceived mediatory role given to Mr. Ali, he said. He, however, was quick to add that the promoters had full respect for any representative appointed by the government and was willing to hold talks to find a way out. Mr. Abdulrahman admitted that he had not yet met Mr. Ali and cited his hectic tour schedule as reason. However, he added that he was prepared to meet Mr. Ali any time. Asked whether SmartCity would adopt a legal route if the mission failed, the CEO's response was Yes, if that is the last resort. Mr. Abdulrahman was asked whether the company wanted freehold rights on 12 per cent land within or outside the project site notified as Special Economic Zone (SEZ). He said that there was no freehold within the ambit of SEZ. It is always outside the SEZ. The government had accepted it and that is why the clause figures in the original framework agreement, he said. Mr. Abdulrahman said that there was no question of compromising or negotiating on the original agreement. Compromise could have happened before the agreement, not after it, he said. The project, he said, was suffering. Jobs are not created. Development is not happening. Foreign direct investment is not coming in. Go around the SmartCity Kochi project area and see how many other ventures have come up in the hope of this project happening, Mr. Abdulrahman said.   OPEN",

The 230 KV will be converted into 110 KV through a step-down process, before ensuring supply to the ELCOT, corporation sources told The Hindu' here on Friday. Work will be taken up shortly after the ELCOT handed over the site and is expected to be completed over a period of six months. The sources said that the TANGEDCO has made all arrangements for ensuring an assured power supply. Demand for power Initially, the ELCOT's demand for power was far less ranging between 5 to 10 MW and obviously the corporation had then sought five acres of land. With the rise in demand for 65 MW, the corporation has planned to set up a sub-station with a capacity of 230 KV, source said. The TANGEDCO will attach priority for the execution of the work. A transformer of 100 MVA capacity would be installed for the supply of power to the park, sources added. Deputy Chief Minister M. K. Stalin inaugurated the IT Park, spread over in 147.61 acres, on December 9. The IT Park has been given the status Special Economic Zone (SEZ). The IT cum administrative building has a space of 50,000 sq. feet.

        "content": " E veryone who has a chance to see nearly two million animals on the move has been touched by the magic of this place.What is it that gets under their skin? The urgency of the movement of the wildebeest? The wide open plains? The African light? Or maybe it is the fact that we all came from here, not such a long time ago, and our deep unconsciousness remembers the time, 60,000 generations agoOr maybe it is just the sheer number of the migrating animals as they move in the worlds last surviving great migration . That was Markus Borner, the Frankfurt Zoo representative in Serengeti, talking about the Great Migration mentioned in the Masai Mara Visitor Map Guide. I had seen it all on the Discovery, National Geographic and Animal Planet channels and elsewhere, done by helicopter shots with multiple cameras by ace photographers wielding the latest gadgets, backed by satellite image experts, ethologists, cartographers and wildlife scientists. Would watching the migrating wildebeest and zebras live be different?I was armed with binoculars and an 8 megapixel 35-420 lens digital camera, was leaning out of a sliding roof safari van, moving in the amazing Serengeti-Masai Mara ecosystem. The White Bearded Wildebeest ( Connochaetes taurinus ) lives without any family ties.There is no leader.Any individual can start walking, and tens of thousands follow. The wildebeest cross the Mara River near the Oloololo Gate and the crossing is a spectacle.Especially since below, waiting knowingly in the river, are the enormous Mara crocodiles. The banks are worn down by hundreds of years of crossings, while at other places they are vertical on both sides of the river.The wildebeest and zebras hurtle down the earth banks, swim 30 to 50 ft and struggle in their teeming hundreds to find a safe way out at the other bank.Many drown or get eaten by crocodiles. The Masai Mara has the second highest lion density in the world with 500 lions in 1,500 km. Thousands of animals are also taken by them and by other predators: leopards, cheetah and hyenas  the latter being serious hunters, not just the scavengers they once were.That said, thousands of animals do cross safely and the statistics for a good year say that 1.5 million cross safely. Further along the route of migration, from the roof of our van, I photograph an intriguing face-off. A pride of lions has apparently killed a migrating zebra and is sitting near the prey.But a matriarch elephant, with huge ears sticking out menacingly, protects the dead zebra, so the lions sit well away from the kill, as though waving a white flag. The knowledgeable van driver, who doubles up as guide, could not explain this confrontation.The vegetarian elephant herd would not be interested in the kill for food.There is no known affinity between zebras and elephants. What does the matriarch with her long tusks expect to accomplish by coming between the lions and their prey? The whole drama unfolds in a leisurely fashion. It is an unhurried face off where one lion, then another, rises and ambles along near the kill, but is under the elephants watchful eye.The lion walks right past the dead zebra, turns round to face the kill, and sits down, as the elephant keeps an eye on him. It is all near a swamp and there are photo opportunities with the birds: Egyptian geese, plovers, egrets, jacanas rise from the muddy environs, sometimes circle around and descend to continue preening and feeding. After an interminable half hour, the duel ends, with the lions strolling away as the matriarch watches. The elephant herd then crosses the dirt road, just 12 ft in front of our van. We dont do anything to the elephants, so they dont do anything to us, you take photo, whispers the driver. Many of my shots are useless because of the camera shakes in my nervous hands. Soon, the spotted hyenas are moving in from afar, to claim their share of the dead zebra. Wanting a better angle for my camera, I open the door to alight from the van. The driver promptly stops me: it is against the law to get off the van when one is inside the park. The only humans that break this law are the Masai, who roam about on foot in the game park, grazing their cattle. Though they dont hunt for food, these tall handsome tribesmen are capable of defending themselves with spear and club. The Masai are yet another plus for me over the TV channels enthralling footage.The driver fixes up a fee with them and they welcome me to their Masai village with a drink of cows blood and cows milk (half measure each). I am too squeamish to accept it. They show how they light a fire using sticks, try to sell trinkets and bangles that they have handcrafted, and do a group dance, with the tall handsome men leaping straight upward. The higher he jumps, the more likely he is to win a bride. Some speak English and joke that the very tall leader is a giraffe. No, I say, pointing at his goatee: He is a goat, as many burst out laughing. Ok, concludes the genial leader, I ama goat-giraffe, he says and grins. Back home in Bangalore, I have a charming anecdote for family and friends: making a ferocious, spear-wielding Masai leader admit to being a goat- giraffe.  The Higher he jumps, the more likely he is to win a bride.  OPEN",

The scheme covered 1,053 students from four Government Hr. Sec. Schools. TNPL spent about Rs.3 lakh for the purpose. TNPL chief general manager, operations, R. Mani, and deputy general manager (human resources) P. Pattabhiraman distributed the notebooks. Mr. Mani said that the TNPL was also commencing special coaching classes later this month at four venues for the benefit of slow learners who would be appearing for the public examinations this academic year.

        "content": " : It has hardly been six months for Manimaran in the job, but he is already calling it quits. After having worked as a supplier' in a dhaba for two years, the 20-year-old joined his uncle in hauling sacks of goods and later, luggage of passengers at Central Railway Station. I was jobless for six months. My uncle has nearly 25 years of experience and told me it is manageable,'' he says, as he takes a break for lunch. But the job was anything but manageable for the youngster. Every morning he waits at a place designated to him by the union members and hunts for his customers for the day. He mainly looks out for senior citizens carrying, at least, a couple of heavy luggage. What follows is minutes of loud negotiations between him and his customers. Depressing It is sometimes depressing to fight with elders. But I have no other choice. If I don't bargain, I would have to settle for a paltry sum of Rs.20 and that might be what I end up earning for the whole day,'' he says. Even as Manimaran is all set to return to his native village near Ariyalur, Pandiraj, another youngster hailing from a neighbouring village, has just signed up to work as a loadman and nurses dreams of earning enough for his family. The porter-turned-loadman now manages with just four hours of afternoon nap during weekdays to save money for his weekend trip to his place. I am going to cut down on the trips as it becomes difficult to save enough for all of us, says the 21-year-old. As many of his relatives are working along with him, Mr. Pandiraj is confident he would get enough support in case he gets into trouble. My grandfather worked as a loadman. He was working till 65 years but one fine day, he was refused any jobs citing his age. He came back to our place, penniless, Mr.Pandiraj recalls. Workers' demands The CITU's Tamil Nadu Sumai Pani Thozhilalar Sammelanam has been lobbying for many cases such as this. Primary among the demands is the setting up of a welfare board for loadmen that would entitle them to retirement benefits. On an average, a loadman is paid Rs.30 per tonne and he manages to earns around Rs.100 every day. But work becomes hell if they have to haggle with ruthless businessmen. There are workers who are paid as low as Rs.10 per sack and end up earning Rs.50 every day, said L.Sundararajan, secretary of the Sammelanam. For many, the physically taxing job has made them take to alcohol at the end of the day. Alcoholism runs in P.Balraj's family, whose father and uncle were disowned by their families as the addiction reached dangerous levels. I also drink a bit, Mr. Balraj says. There is no way out. Every nerve in the body would ache at the end of the day. But I am cautious not to overdo it like my father did.   OPEN",

        "content": " My early experience of international arts festivals were the Edinburgh and Brighton festivals in the United Kingdom. Dancing in these festivals was an experience beyond my own performances, impressed as I was with the infinite variety and impeccable planning. I returned to Madras and gave vent to my dreams for a Madras Festival on those lines in a then popular magazine called Aside'. I am afraid that dream might take long to ever become a reality. I say that because it is not enough for artists alone to have a vision. We need artistically oriented organisers who can make up a core team to evolve a magnificent festival that can encompass all our arts and spread its wings to reach out to cities and towns all over the State. Professional arts management is something that has not been understood in India. Artistic direction is a nurturing factor that has made artists, then in the West and now even in countries of the far East feel that their work is getting the right support. Millions are spent when a sports event is hosted by a city. Do we get even decent roads for our little festival here? There seems to be a distinct divide between government-supported arts festivals and privately sponsored ones. Cannot the two come together and plan the two or three month-long events properly and publicise it with thoughtful care? Starting with youth' events in November, music in December and dance in January, the calendar can be evolved without confusion. The folk arts coming to the city for Pongal should be reciprocated with classical arts going to the smaller towns, temple towns, villages and so on. New venues and rejuvenation of old venues would be a boon to the jaded concert enthusiast. We keep talking of heritage, but hardly initiate any new perspectives. When I danced in an old church in Amsterdam, with candle lights in the background, I could feel the audience responding in a special way. The acoustics and ambience were just superb. Why can't we have both Carnatic and Western music concerts in some of our old Madras churches? Would it not be exotic to have young dancers perform in the bronze gallery of the Madras museum? A pithy introduction by a genuine scholar on the great sculptures and their reflection in our dances would be a lovely experience. Kalakshetra has built a temple pond for concerts, and it is a charming venue. Should this not encourage us to have some concerts by the kulam' in the Kandaswamy temple in George Town or the Tiruvidandai temple tank? People in those areas would relish such an atmosphere. Old palaces in the districts can become modern day Sangeeta mahals. In fact, the Thanjavur palace has been ignored as a suitable venue for music and dance performances. Our festival of arts  the season', has now expanded to include innumerable events, lectures and so on. But a vision for a future which benefits artists and also the next generation needs to be evolved by a think tank of intellectuals who are deeply committed to our arts. I may dance a season in Jacobs Pillow in Boston and relish the ambiencebut I would like to realise a dream festival right here.

An additional floor added to the trauma block will also be opened once the high-end equipment, being procured with Central government fund, arrives. The casualty block will house blood bank, laboratories for biochemistry and pathology, and a cardiac cath lab, which will enable the hospital to begin a postgraduation course in cardiothoracic surgery, Kilpauk Medical College Dean V. Kanagasabai said. A modern kitchen is also being established and the Obstetrics and Gynaecology block of the hospital has been improved. Three buildings have been constructed at the medical college, including a faculty block and a hostel for students. Permission has been granted to build seven floors and in the first phase, we have built four floors. The hostel will have 50 rooms with a facility to accommodate 150 students. The faculty block will begin functioning from March, the Dean said. Senior hospital authorities, however, said that the new buildings would barely meet the hospital's growing needs. Since approval for new buildings were sought by the hospital administration a few years ago and revising the proposal would delay the construction by at least a year, officials refrained from seeking revision of the building plans, they said. Monsoon woes The hospital and the college premises are inundated during monsoon, forcing the college to declare holiday. The authorities said that while the level of Poonamallee High Road is being continually raised, the hospital and college remained at a lower level resulting in inundation. Two years ago, the college authorities had sent a proposal to the State government to construct a well inside the hospital to drain the overflow from the Chetpet Lake and rainwater from the nearby areas. It was suggested that the rainwater could be released into the lake or drained after monsoon. Hospital authorities said that the plan was shelved as it was estimated that the project would cost the government Rs.5 crore.   OPEN",

        "content": " : In 1981, Naman Ramachandran went along with some friends to watch the Malayalam film, Garjanam , which uniquely featured two superstars in the lead role. A few schedules of the film were shot with Malayalam actor Jayan in the lead who died in an accident while shooting for another film. The remaining portions were filmed with Rajinikanth, then a rising star in Tamil, playing the protagonist. Being diehard fans of Jayan, the schoolboys in Alappuzha went into the cinema prepared to hate Rajinikanth. But we couldnt. He had done a brilliant job of it, recalls Mr. Ramachandran, film critic and journalist who has now authored a biography of the superstar, titled, Rajinikanth: The Definitive Biography. In a conversation with The Hindu here on Saturday, Mr. Ramachandran said unavailability of any credible tome on the biggest superstar of India  in terms of depth of reach  was what got him thinking of piecing one together. After a two-year spadework during which he interviewed Rajinis friends, relatives, mentors, critics, and co-workers in the film industry exhaustively, he penned the tome as a hardcore reportage, largely adhering to journalisms thumb rules of objectivity, fairness, honesty, and a sense of balance. Vital clues That way, it is the worlds largest feature, he chuckles. Adopting the Andrew Robinson-model (author of Satyajit Ray: The Inner Eye: The Biography of a Master Filmmaker), Mr. Ramachandran let people who have known and understood Rajini talk about him, limiting his intervention to occasionally juxtaposing people so that the readers can glean vital clues to the dimensions of an issue under discussion. In the authors own words, he has contextualised the phenomenon of Rajinikanth. The reader will, therefore, come across the history of the Dravidian Movement, the evolution of Tamil culture and film industry, and the growth of Kannada cinema which help place the actor in a certain milieu. Theres quite a bit of wrong information doing the rounds on Rajini. The user-generated Wikipedia, almost everyones reference guide these days, says a five-year-old Rajini was shattered by his mothers death. But when I spoke to his brother Satyanarayana, he said Rajini was just over nine when their mother died. The tragedy hadnt hit him very hard. He was too small to fathom the gravity of the loss, Mr. Satyanarayana told me, recalls Mr. Ramachandran. Primary task As he set about the project, humanising the larger-than-life star was the authors primary task. In fact, Rajini has always distanced himself from his own-screen image, which, as filmmaker S.P. Muthuraman said, was entirely manufactured to produce a heir to MGRs legacy (M.G. Ramachandran). Kamal Hassan was already identified as Shivaji Ganesans successor, but there was a vacuum created by MGRs sojourn to politics. So they set out to create a successor to MGR, which became evident from [Rajini-starred] Murattukkalai [1980], says Mr. Ramachandran, likening it to Salim-Javeds creation of the angry young man. From the biography, which also features the authors deconstruction of a few Rajini films, the on-screen phenomenon of Rajini is analysed threadbare in chronological order. Theres quite a bit of criticism as well. The author rips the movie Kuselan to bits, to cite an instance.  Naman Ramachandrans biography of Rajinikanth attempts to humanise the larger-than-life star.

        "content": " : A man with an elusive past was how a senior police investigator described Hari Hara Varma, the 68-year-old man who was murdered for his stash of gem stones of questionable value here on December 24. Investigators, who verified Varmas antecedents, said they had so far found it hard to pin down or reconstruct the life story of the self-appointed scion of a former ruling family of an erstwhile princedom in Central Kerala. The family has since denied that Varma was their relative. A school-leaving certificate found among his possessions show that Varma had passed out of the Sri Gujarati Vidyalaya at Mattanchery in 1968. The current authorities of the school, who verified other certificates they had issued that year, told the investigators that the signature of the headmaster on the certificate was fake. The late T. P. Mathew, father of T.M. Thomas Isaac, former Finance Minister and CPI(M) legislator from Alapuzzha, had headed the school that year and his signature did not match the one on Varmas certificate. Investigators said Varmas two wives also could not shed much light on their husbands origins, parents or his past. He had married both of them within a span of a few years and neither knew of the others existence. The women had met him through matrimonial advertisements Varma had placed in newspapers. They told the police that Varma had attended the marriage ceremonies alone, maintaining that his royal family frowned upon his marriage with a member of another caste. Varma has properties in his name in Palakkad and Thiruvananthapuram. Diaries found The police found two diaries in which Varma has listed his contacts, most of them shady dealers who sold common place objects and recently crafted artefacts as talismans and antiques possessing magical properties to credulous buyers. They said Varma stressed his privileged position to sell his heirlooms, mostly gems and stone idols of scarce value, to unsuspecting buyers. He was loath to let anybody closely examine the gems and would get roused if anyone dared suggest that they were fake. Investigators have now sought Varmas passport details in a bid to unravel the past of a man who apparently does not seem to have one.  OPEN",

Ideation-wise, I wonder if such a production would have been possible 20-30 years ago. Vijay Sampath, CEO of Amar Chitra Katha, said they had been working for over eight months to bring out the book. They came upon the subject when they toyed with the idea of expanding genres to cater to people from different sections. Earlier, we had graphic novels on people like Jim Corbett and Uncle Pai. When we thought of entering the field of art, we thought the apt subject would be M.S. Subbulakshmi. Since we cater to a young audience, we want to bring out the inspirational elements in the stories as well, he said. R. Krishnaswamy of Narada Gana Sabha received the first copy of the graphic novel on Friday.  OPEN",

Seventy beagles, who spent nearly two months in cells, were freed on Saturday evening, after a sustained campaign by animal rights activists. Animal welfare board officials, who had been waiting since Saturday morning, finally received their little charges around 6 p.m. There is really nothing left to say, said Chinny Krishna, chairperson, animal welfare board. The puppies, bred by Beijing Marshall Biotechnology Company Limited were imported by Advinus laboratory. They arrived at the Chennai airport on October 19 and have been in quarantine ever since. Their release from the centre was withheld after a Central government panel regulating experimentation on animals found some violations in their import documentation.  \"The puppies will now go to good homes  some have already been identified, while volunteers of non-governmental organisations are looking for others. We are not just giving them away to anyone, said Sathya, a volunteer with the People for Animals. People who want to adopt a puppy must be ready to spay, neuter and vaccinate them within six months. We are doing background checks and will also be conducting home visits to ensure the puppies are being looked after. Dawn Williams, general manager, Blue Cross India, said: We are all very happy. And going by excited woofs of the puppies as they finally taste freedom, he wasnt the only one. Arun Mohan, who has just adopted the smallest puppy, is another happy person. Our puppy is settling in very well. He was very quiet at first but once he got used to us, he became very active and frisky, he said. Priya Rajesh who waited all day to get her puppy is thrilled at the new arrival. Hes a little jittery and nervous but Im sure he will get over it. He is now part of our family, she said.  OPEN",

According to sources at ICGS, a team of bikers of ICG started from Mangalore on Thursday to promote the safety-awareness drive along the coastal fishing hamlets of Karnataka. A total of 16 participants from the various Coast Guard units of Karnataka, Indian Navy and the Coastal Security Police participated in the drive. The motorcyclists had to cover more than 600 km. The drive was symbolic of the efforts made in awakening the coastal denizens towards adopting the prescribed safety regulations at sea. Moreover, the hub and spoke concept of mutual dependence was the need of the hour in the context of national security, said the sources. The participants were flagged off from Mangalore on December 13 by Pratap Reddy, Inspector-General of Police, Western range. They visited villages along Surathkal, Sashihithlu, and Kaup Beach and Malpe before entering Bhatkal and spent a night there. The CSP and fishermen gave them a warm welcome. On December 14, after transiting the landing points and fishermen villages, bikers arrived at Karwar via Murudeshwar, Honnavar, and Belekeri. The ICGS said the drive strengthened the ties between the CSP, the Indian Navy, and the Indian Coast Guard as representatives from all organisations participated in the drive.

        "content": " After focussing on the international climate change negotiations in Doha earlier this month, the spotlight is shifting back to the domestic scene. India can point the finger at the failure of rich countries to check the growth of their greenhouse gas emissions, but its not a rosy picture back home either. Over the last decade or so, Indias emissions  which now make up five per cent of global emissions, the third highest in the world  have displayed a clear shift from agriculture, where rice cultivation and livestock contribute to methane production. On the other hand, the energy and industrial sectors, which mostly produce carbon dioxide, now hold an increasing share of the total. Between 1994 and 2007, the year-on-year growth rate of agriculture emissions was only 0.6 per cent. Emissions from the energy sector grew at a rate of 4.8 per cent over the same period. The recent trend is weighted towards industrial processes. Between 1994 and 2000, the year-on-year growth of emissions from this sector was only two per cent. In the period between 2000 and 2007, this shot up to seven per cent. Even though starting from a low base, emissions from waste have also risen sharply  seeing a 7.3 per cent growth rate between 1994 and 2007  with urbanisation generating ever-larger quantities of municipal waste. The estimates for 2007 show that the energy sector  including power, transport and residential electricity  was responsible for 58 per cent of Indias emissions, with industry and agriculture following at 22 and 17 per cent. In a bid to slow down domestic emissions growth, the government launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008. Eight national missions  dealing with solar energy, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture and habitats, water and forestry, the Himalayan ecosystem and research  were charted under the plan. However, a recent academic analysis of the missions found that some mid-stream corrections need to be made. The study, jointly released by the IIT-Madras and the Institute of Financial Management and Researchs Centre for Development Finance, identified both strengths and weaknesses in the missions, pointing out that they often read as vague, all-encompassing planning documents, rather than specific missions with clearly chalked-out priorities and strategies. The two missions on mitigation  solar energy and energy efficiency  are more sharply defined, but if you look at something as large and complicated as the agriculture mission, it looks as though it was just rolled out hastily in time for [the critical 2009 UN summit at] Copenhagen without sufficient thought, says Sujatha Byravan, the lead author of the study. The energy efficiency mission, which has been the poster-boy of the Plan at international forums, is not ambitious enough, she says. They wanted to get buy-in from industry, and that is a good thing, but it leaves out many major challenges. For example, Indias energy losses in distribution and transmission are huge. That needs to be addressed much more. A major drawback in the Plan, she feels, is that in many ways, it stresses a lower-carbon model of the existing development path. We have the opportunity to re-imagine our development pathway. For example, urban planning needs to revolve round non-motorised transport. Market compulsions Some progress may be taking place as much because of market compulsions, as government policies. With energy prices shooting up  whether coal, electricity, oil, in fact gas is exorbitant  there is an autonomous change within the industry simply to survive, says Chandra Bhushan, deputy director- general of the Centre for Science and Environment, who did a study in 2009 of the six most emissions-intensive industries, which together account for more than 60 per cent of the sectors emissions. I have never heard the thermal power sector talking about energy efficiency so much. Whether its cement or steel, they are very worried about energy prices, and everyone is looking for alternatives, he says. Renewable energy  which stands at 28,000 MW today  is being propelled by market forces. Look at the wind energy sector in Tamil Nadu. It is being promoted by the textile industry simply because it is a cheaper source of energy. He feels that if the government can galvanise these market forces, it could make a bigger difference than regulatory regimes such as the PAT scheme. The government feels that the NAPCC has to be given time to work. All eight missions are being implemented, says R.R. Rashmi, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and a key negotiator on the Indian team in Doha. He lists the solar and energy-efficiency missions as those which have started bearing fruit. You have to realise that missions like agriculture and water are long-term adaptation missions. Given that the missions were launched in 2008 and were planned to run till 2017, they have almost reached the halfway point. However, the Prime Ministers Council on Climate Change, which launched the Plan and which was supposed to monitor its progress, has not met in the last two and a half years, Mr. Rashmi admits. He adds that the NAPCC is only one part of Indias climate strategy. The 12th Five Year Plan, which has just been approved by the Cabinet, will play a key role in moving the country into a sustainable development and low-carbon growth pathway. However, Mr. Rashmi notes that international finance  a thorny issue at the Doha talks  is critical as well. To the extent that we can work with domestic funds, we will do, but global funding is also needed.  OPEN",

        "content": " The results of the United Nations climate change conference that closed in Doha, Qatar, last week show once again that the international negotiations are moving steadily in the right direction, but are alarmingly slow. At the heart of these negotiations is nothing less than the most challenging energy transformation the world has ever seen. Past energy transitions have taken a long time to unfold. Firewood was mankinds first energy source and was not displaced by coal until the 18th century. With an increasing pace of technological advance, it took one century for oil to replace coal as the primary global energy source. Climate change is not the only motivation to move toward more renewables and enhanced energy efficiency, but it has injected unequivocal urgency into an otherwise normal evolution. Despite the evident challenge of capital stock turnover in our existing energy systems, time is not on our side. Science tells us that global greenhouse gas emissions must peak this decade and decrease rapidly thereafter. More importantly, peaking of global emissions must occur soon if we are to lessen human costs. Global extreme weather events in every region of the world provide ample proof of the mounting human costs, in particular to the most vulnerable. The U.N. is the only platform that grants all countries, large and small, access to global decision-making. The shift toward low carbon requires global participation because every single country is already affected by climate change, and because of the need to deliberately guide an accelerated global changeover. Furthermore, the scale and pace of economic development driven by technology and the free movement of capital makes global participation essential. The low-emission economies of today, even on a per capita basis, can and will become high-emission economies of tomorrow faster than was ever possible unless they are adequately supported and encouraged to engineer clean energy futures for themselves. Following important steps forward taken over the last two years at Cancun and Durban, in Doha 37 countries (all European Union members, Australia, Belarus, Croatia, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Norway, Switzerland, and Ukraine) adopted legally binding emission reduction targets bringing them collectively to a level 18 per cent below their 1990 baselines over the next eight years. The targets are underpinned by stricter accounting rules and are open to further strengthening by 2014. In addition, in Doha all countries confirmed their determination to reach an agreement applicable to all by December 2015, based on the latest science. Governments are clearly steering the world toward a major transformation, but have not yet proven their intent through a robust and immediate implementation of what has already been promised. Governments must and can accelerate climate change action, not because of altruistic reasons, but because it is in their national interest to do so. Domestic action The U.N. is the venue for global decision-making, but it is not the driver of domestic decisions. Domestic interests in resource sustainability, stability and competitiveness are the powerful drivers of action on climate change. The UN process is the centre of international engagement, but it is not the circumference of action on climate change. In response to the slow but steady progress in international negotiations, and to capitalize on the new low-carbon economy, 33 countries and 18 sub-national jurisdictions will have carbon pricing in place in 2013, covering 30 per cent of the global economy and 20 per cent of emissions. By 2011, 118 countries had climate change legislation or renewable energy targets, more than double the number in 2005. There are increasing local, voluntary efforts to reduce deforestation and emissions not covered by the U.N. framework. In 2010, renewables accounted for 20.3 per cent of worldwide electricity, compared to 3.4 per cent in 2006. Investment in clean energy has surpassed $1 trillion and is expected to grow to almost $400 billion annually. The signs of movement toward low-carbon are everywhere, but are still insufficient. Low-carbon must soon be the norm and not the novelty. Governments have charted the course, but they are moving slowly. None are at maximum potential. Neither is anyone else. The private sector can and should move more purposefully. The finance sector can and should invest more aggressively. Technology can and must advance more rapidly. No one is exempt from the responsibility, or from the opportunity, to contribute to the solution. We need maximum effort from everyone. We need to move beyond the zero-sum mentality to cooperative action in pursuit of an urgent shared objective. We need mutually reinforcing efforts to accelerate the momentum toward a low emission economy. Together we can migrate from the politics of blame to the politics of opportunity. The 2015 agreement must ensure equitable participation of all nations and be responsive to the exigencies of science. Above all, it must be a testament to the will of our generation to act. Ultimately, history will judge us on whether we have reduced greenhouse gases enough to avoid the worst climate change. The fact is that we can do this right now in ways that both boost the economic sustainability of everyone and at the same time safeguard those most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. And that is why a universal agreement is necessary and possible. (Christiana Figueres is Executive Secretary, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.)

        "content": " Ayacutdars of the Veeranam tank have appealed to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to immediately release water from the tank to save samba crop on 52,000 acres spread across the Chidambaram and Kattumannarkoil blocks. They have also appealed to the government to revise the water management policy to ensure adequate supply for the irrigation requirements of tail-end delta region. P. Vinayagamoorthy, president of the Kollidam-Keelanai Paasana Vivasayigal Sangam, in a representation to the Chief Minister said the standing crops in the region were withering and therefore tapping water from the tank for the drinking needs of Chennai should be stopped. Instead, water from 40 deep borewells sunk at a cost of Rs. 49 crore from Sethiathope to Panruti could be utilised. He said for the current crop season, Mettur water was released only on September 17, 2012, three months behind schedule. Subsequently, water from the Kallanai was released on September 21 and from the Keelanai (Lower Anicut) on September 30. Even though water from the Lower Anicut had raised the Veeranam tank level to 42.5 ft (maximum level 47.5 ft), the authorities opened the sluices only on November 17 and December 2 after several agitations. Mr. Vinayagamoorthy noted that to save the crops, water ought to be released from the tank from January 10. The association also sought increased allocation of water from the Lower Anicut to the Veeranam tank. As of now, 10 per cent of water realisation at the Lower Anicut was being released to the Veeranam tank. It must be enhanced to 15 per cent to compensate about 5 per cent of water being drawn by local bodies in Thanjavur, Airyalur and Perambalur districts from the borewells on the Kollidam river bed (which would otherwise be utilised for irrigation).

        "content": " The year 2012 buzzed with cloud and mobile applications, making waves in the field of information technology. Looking forward, what are the technologies and products that are going to be game-changers in the coming months? Lets begin with e-commerce. Websites that allow you to turn the Internet into a virtual shopping centre has not taken off in the Indian market so far. Given the extent of Internet penetration, access to credit cards or online access to banks, this is still a slowly evolving market. But, Indian companies tweaked this concept by offering cash on delivery, which has enabled a lot of Indians to shop online. FlipKart is one such example. And other sites have followed suit, indicating that this trend is only going to catch on more in the coming months. Mobile applications supporting e-commerce are also going to fly high. Mobile phone penetration in India is much more than computers; this is a well-known fact. Now, with smartphones getting more affordable, it is possible to write sophisticated applications that will work on most mobile phones. Mobile applications are also becoming very common in education-related, content delivery applications. Another notable trend is that a lot of universities and private institutions are delivering educational content online, even offering courses and conducting examinations. For instance, the online education site coursera.org has grown in popularity over the last year. Such sites allow students to take a complete course here, offered by various universities. Technically, if you notice, all these are Web applications. These applications may run in some data centre or may be hosted in the cloud. Wherever they are hosted, these applications involve a database such as MySQL, Web development language like Python, PHP and HTML/Javascript combination to programme the user interface. Popular content management systems such as Drupal, education application such as Moodle are developed in PHP. Python is also gaining popularity fast. Model-View-Controller, an architecture paradigm, is supported by frameworks such as CodeIgniter for PHP, DJango for Python, etc., which are very helpful for developers in implementing Web applications. The front-end In the front-end, that is the browser, user interface of the application has HTML/Javascript. Sophisticated user interface does a lot with Javascript. Currently, there is no other choice but Javascript for developers to handle Document Object Model (DOM) objects. HTML5 with Javascript may build beautiful user interfaces. However, it is unfortunate that developers cannot select from a spectrum of languages to implement user interfaces, compared to the wide choices that are available when it comes to back-end programming. Handling data With more and more data going online, data handling needs are going up. Researchers and statistical analysts always encounter limitations in handling data. Research areas such as meteorology or genomics face huge data handling needs. These data handling requirements are beyond the capacity of current database applications. Industry answers this with big data. What is big data about? Companies have their regulated data in their database. Beyond this, information comes in the form of email, white papers, documents, etc., which may be crucial in making important decisions, and may form a good knowledge base of any organisation. But, how does one organise, store and extract information from these different types of data  most of which may not be in any particular format or structure. This is where this emerging field becomes crucial. Big data includes the ability to handle data sets and formats beyond the ability of commonly available software. MIKE (Methodology for an Integrated Management Environment) sees big data as anything which includes high degree of complexity within the data sets and needs to be analysed. Though size is the primary definition of big data, the answer lies in independent data sources. Apache Hadoop With different sources of data, it takes a lot of computing power to map data and analyse it to get some meaningful information. Software that supports big data should be able to run in multiple machines in order to get this job done. Apache Hadoop is one such application that is being widely used by corporations nowadays. NoSQL database applications  which are meant to handle huge data that does not fall in any particular structure and, hence, cannot apply any SQL to it  are also becoming important in the IT industry where big data manipulations are needed. Unlike in many fields where proprietary solutions are followed by Free Software equivalents, the trend is more or less reversed in big data. Free Software such as Apache Hadoop and NoSQL applications such as MangoDB are already very popular, and have made their mark in this emerging field.

Set against the backdrop of the 2004 tsunami, The Impossible is based on a true story. The Bennetts  Maria, husband Henry and three sons Lucas (10), Simon (71/2) and Thomas (5) come to Thailand to celebrate Christmas. When the tsunami strikes, the family is separated. What follows is the desperate search through a destroyed landscape (thats where the MKD moment comes in). This is a rare disaster movie that instead of intercutting between many tales chooses to stay with this family. It is also a movie where the special effects dont overwhelm the human story. That the actors are so good helps to ensure that we care for them. Naomi Watts shines as is expected from her as Maria. We weep with her and her pain is ours. Her scenes with Tom Holland, who plays Lucas, are heartrending. Ewan McGregor is also super brilliant as Henry and it is difficult to remain dry-eyed when he calls home. Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast are beyond cute as Simon and Thomas. Director Bayona (The Orphanage) has created a gripping disaster movie (the scene where the wave strikes is truly horrific) with an emotional core. At the end of the movie, you have been shocked, awestruck at the fury of nature, wept tears of despair and rejoiced in the triumph of human spirit and generosity. It is a Greek tragedy complete with catharsis. MINI ANTHIKAD-CHHIBBER  OPEN",

The incident led to an instant road blockade by villagers on the Arakkonam-Sholinghur Road for about six hours on Saturday morning. According to police, M. Peethambaram was waiting at the Panavattambatti bus stop at 5 a.m. to go to Ranipet. As none of the Ranipet-bound mofussil buses stopped there, he walked towards nearby Aippedu to board a bus. The poultry-laden van proceeding towards Sholinghur fatally knocked him down. On hearing about the accident, people of Panavattambatti blocked traffic on the road demanding immediate steps to direct all mofussil buses to stop at Panavattambatti. Police personnel, including V.K. Arunachalam, Inspector, from the Sholinghur Police Station tried to pacify the agitators. But, they demanded a written undertaking from private bus owners that they would stop all buses between Arakkonam and Sholinghur at Panavattambatti. Arakkonam DSP S. Seetharam and Arakkonam tahsildar Thameem promised the agitators that they would take steps. The agitators dispersed at 11.30 a.m. Mr. Arunachalam said that on his request, Mohan, Regional Transport Officer, Ranipet, went to the Sholinghur police station where private bus company owners operating on the Sholinghur-Arakkonam route were summoned. The RTO asked the bus owners to stop their buses at Panavattambatti with immediate effect. The Inspector said private buses were not stopping at the bus stop for a long time as the name board of the bus stop had been damaged. The president of Thalikkal village panchayat (in which jurisdiction Panavattambatti was located) was asked to reinstall the name board. Van driver Jayaraman of Edappalayam Colony was arrested.

        "content": " The Union and State governments will have to take proactive initiatives to prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change , according to Sayeed Mohammed, coordinator, Progressive Youth Vellore. He was speaking on Climate change and its impact at a meeting organised by Progressive Youth Vellore, a forum for mobilising youth to react to social and environmental problems impacting on society and bring about changes through interactions with the government, at C. Abdul Hakeem College of Engineering and Technology in Melvisharam on Saturday. Mr. Mohammed, who is a scientist working with the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development, said that global warming resulting from greenhouse effect and the resultant climate change had the potential to dry up water bodies and render agriculture and fishing impossible. Industrial revolution of 1760 Climate change being witnessed in developed and developing countries today was the result of the industrial revolution of 1760, leading to deforestation and pumping of carbon dioxide into the environment. The invention of steam engine and extraction of coal for industrial purposes changed the whole system. Carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere had increased to 35 per cent, he claimed. The level of other gases had also increased. The average temperature had risen by 0.8 degrees Celsius in the last 100 years resulting in casualties in Bangladesh and Philippines. Countries such as Maldives were likely to be submerged between 2032 and 2045 owing to the rise in the sea level, he said. The Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change had come up with scientific results pertaining to different parts of the world. It had found that global warming was inevitable and that greenhouse effects would increase the temperature by 5 to 7 degrees Celsius in the years to come. While the impact of climate change would be more in Asia, the social cost of climate change would be much higher in India. The impact could be seen in increasing water scarcity, destruction of soil fertility owing to the use of fertilizers and pesticides, fall in water level in lakes and drying up of agricultural fields. On how people in Vellore could help in preventing the effects of climate change, Mr. Mohammed said they could think of utilising alternative sources of power such as solar energy. In areas where groundwater had been polluted by tanneries and industries, people should approach the government to ensure active monitoring of emission standards followed by industries.  OPEN",

The three-day festival has been organised by the National Association of Street Vendors of India. Describing street food as the best in the world, Union Tourism Secretary Parvez Dewan said India has the potential in this kind of food but the country lags behind Thailand and other East Asian countries. A five-member delegation from Singapore Tourism is monitoring the way the festival is being organised. According to NASVIs programme manager Ranjit Abhigyan, the second day saw over 25,000 footfalls. Ten thousand food lovers came on the first day. The festivals basic objective is to demonstrate the cooking skills of street vendors. They are second to none when it comes to knowledge about what constitutes delicious and healthy food. We also wanted to dispel the misconception among the middle class and policymakers that street food is unhygienic and unhealthy.

        "content": " Sharp, incisive and no-holds-barred. That is the trend of public speeches today. Undoubtedly, public representatives take the cake for it. Leaders across the political spectrum are indulging in rabble rousing and getting away with it. Needless to say, political expediency has taken a march over ethics and decorum. Few remember that words can make or mar, heal or wound. There is nothing new about Majlis leader Akbaruddins speeches, which are now the talk of the town. They are always laced with pun, sarcasm and ridicule. Only this time he seems to have crossed the limits going overboard. His Nirmal speech surely has put the Majlis on the spot at a time when it is going all out to teach a lesson to the Congress, with which it has snapped ties. Even diehard Majlis supporters feel that Mr. Akbaruddin has done a political hara-kiri by making insinuating statements against religious personalities. He just got carried away and doesnt really want to hurt anybodys sentiments, some say. Whatever the case may be, the controversial speech has not gone down well with Muslims either. Many feel embarrassed at the tone and tenor of the speech. But Mr. Akbaruddin is not alone in making such incendiary utterances. Many leaders of right wing organisations, such as the VHP and BJP, too cock-a-snook at the law with impunity. Strangely, police have refused to act, emboldening the leaders to pour venom at will. But why the swift action in Mr. Akbaruddins case? Many see it as a corollary to the Majlis parting ways with the Congress, its ally of several decades. The party enjoyed unbridled freedom during former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddys tenure so much so that police were afraid to act in the old city, the Majlis fiefdom. Tacit understanding Though the Majlis maintains that it has never been a pre-poll ally of the Congress, the fact remains that the parties had a tacit understanding, with both drawing mutual benefits. The Congress reaped electoral gains with the Muslim United Front, of which Majlis is a major constituent, campaigning for it openly during 2004 and 2009. On the Telangana issue also, the ruling party has drawn comfort from the consistent stand of the Majlis for a united State. The sudden aggressive postures by the Majlis, many think, is part of its political build up to the 2014 elections. Its decision to break free from the Congress is also part of this grand strategy and not so much the result of the Bhagyalaxmi temple row. During the election year the Majlis does not want to sail with the scam-ridden Congress, political analysts say. The rise of the Majlis has been phenomenal from the lone representation of late Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi in the State Legislature in 1962 to seven MLAs, one MP and 45 corporators. What is more, when other parties have suffered erosion in their vote bank, the Majlis by and large retained its support base. Under the current president Asaduddin Owaisi, the party is trying to improve its base in Telangana and Rayalaseema. Political empowerment alone will end injustices of all kinds and help Muslims get a fair share of the national resources, Mr. Asaduddin feels. He is of the firm view that the formation of Telangana will result in the BJP emerging stronger. And the muscle flexing is seen as an attempt to polarise votes on religious lines. For the BJP, which lost whatever base it had in the state capital, the Bhagyalaxmi temple issue has come as a blessing in disguise to revive its prospects. Now, has this star speaker dealt a body blow to the Majlis with his intemperate speech? The YSR Congress, with whom the Majlis is reportedly trying to forge an alliance, might shy away from the idea as it would not like to hurt the Hindu electorate. Or will the Majlis emerge stronger from this mess? Only time will tell.  The sudden aggressive postures by the Majlis is said to be part of its political build-up to the 2014 elections. Its decision to break free from the Congress is also part of this grand strategy. During the election year the Majlis does not want to sail with the scam-ridden party  OPEN",

        "content": " Already wilting under sharp criticism from within over the hefty surcharge levied on power consumers, the Congress leaders are now jittery over the latest move to hike power tariffs once again. Having already angered the consumers by imposing Fuel Surcharge Adjustment (FSA), the Government as well as power utilities were only rubbing salt on their wounds, Congress party leaders say. They joined the chorus of other opposition parties in demanding review of the decision while Congress MLCs -- K. Yadava Reddy and K.R. Amos openly hit out at Mr. Kiran Kumar Reddy for burdening consumers further. Why are such crucial issues not discussed with all senior leaders? We want the Chief Minister to realise that this move is totally wrong, they said. They said Congressmen have lost count of the number of times tariff had been hiked by the present regime. Ponguleti Sudhakar Reddy, another Congress MLC, demanded withdrawal of the proposal while Government Whip Rudraraju Padmaraju echoed similar views. When contacted, at least three Ministers, while refusing to go on record, said the hike had been poorly timed since the ruling party was already grappling with two prickly issues -- Statehood for Telangana, defections to the YSR Congress. A Minister feared the Congress may have to pay a heavy price in the elections but hastened to add that the Government had few options, given the precarious power situation. Hydel generation has been hit due to poor monsoon and inadequate gas supplies for thermal stations have only compounded the situation, he added. The Government, he said, was forced to purchase RLNG-based power at Rs 10 a unit. Another Minister defended the Government, claiming that AP alone was not facing the crisis. Look at Tamil Nadu and Karnataka where the consumers are paying higher tariffs, the Minister said. Leaders, who know the ground realities, are pinning hopes on Eastern grid to be linked with the southern grid so that the power transmission becomes easier in the next few months. Presently, the Government is getting RLNG from the Western grid at exorbitant rates.

With tickets for most of the trains and RTC regular buses heading to coastal districts almost sold out for Thursday, Friday and Saturday, many private bus operators in the city are charging nearly double the regular fares. APSRTC, which is planning to operate over 4,000 special buses from Wednesday, is also set to charge 50 per cent extra fare than the regular ticket for travelling in these buses. Cashing in on the demand, many private operators are charging Rs.1,400 per head against the regular fare of Rs. 550 from Hyderabad to Visakhapatnam in a non-AC bus. Similarly, those willing to travel in AC buses in the same route will have to shell out Rs. 2,200 per head against Rs. 900 charged regularly. Likewise, those travelling to Vijayawada from the capital too have to dig deep into their pockets to reach their destination. Generally, Rs.700 is charged for travelling in an AC bus, but operators are now demanding about Rs.1,400 and for those travelling in non-AC buses, the fares have been increased from Rs. 300 to Rs.700. With Sankranti scheduled to be celebrated on Monday, there is an extended holiday. Most of the tickets in trains and 1,000 regular RTC buses from Friday have been sold out already. While second class ticket booking in Godavari, Visakha, Falaknuma, Machilipatnam, Narsapur and express trains is almost closed for Friday, the waiting list for the same trains on Saturday and Sunday stretches to 350 and above. South Central Railway announced few special trains, but these trains hardly meet the passenger demand. Majority of the tickets for regular RTC buses operating towards Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Ongole, Nellore and Tirupati and other regions are already sold out, said a senior RTC official. Though special buses would be operated, passengers will have to bear the pinch of 50 per cent extra charge. For instance, those travelling to Vijayawada in an RTC special non air-conditioned bus will have to pay nearly Rs. 390 per head against the Rs. 265 regular fare.   OPEN",

The registration charges are being raised in tune with the increase in the market value of properties in the State from the beginning of the next fiscal. It is on the market value of the property that stamp duty, transfer duty and registration fee are collected at certain percentage. Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy gave the green signal for enhancement of market value from April 1, while reviewing a long-pending proposal here on Saturday along with Stamps & Registration Minister Thota Narasimham. Mr. Narasimham told reporters later that as per the Central guidelines, the government should enhance the market value of properties -- lands or buildings/flats -- once in two years in rural areas and yearly in urban areas. However, it kept these rates static since 2011 in order to avoid any additional burden on the people. Fresh estimates of the increase in market value had been prepared four months ago but the government kept the implementation in cold storage this time too. He said the enhancement of market value had become inevitable as real estate values had gone up everywhere. Mr. Kiran Reddy issued instructions to rationalise the rates by reducing them in the areas where they were very high and enhance them where they were too low. The Minister said the area-specific new rates estimated for properties would be displayed on notice-boards of the sub-registrar office and the relevant website for a month from now, inviting objections from public. Finally, the revision of the market value, after adjustments following public objections, would be implemented from April 1. Mr Narasimham said the department had earned a revenue of Rs.4,500 crore till December 31 against the target of Rs.6,665 crore fixed for the 2012-13. The shortfall would be made up as there were still three months to go for the current fiscal.

He said tenant farmers were put to serious trouble by the banks which refused to extend loans to those not providing collateral security. Few banks were following guidelines laid down by the State government as there was no effective monitoring. Addressing a District Level Review Committee of banks here, Mr. Sambasiva Rao said only 16,616 LECs were given in the current financial year compared to about 40,000 in the previous year and even the quantum of financial assistance given to the card-holders was well below the targets. Of the 16,616 LEC-holders, only 7,242 farmers got Rs. 16.90 crore. The State Bank of India (SBI) lent Rs. 95.91 lakh to only 440 out of total 4,368 beneficiaries to whom it was supposed to extend credit facility. The performance of other banks is far from satisfactory. Chaitanya Godavari Grameena Bank stood out by giving Rs. 12.64 crore to 5,134 out of 5,940 farmers. The purpose of the much-touted financial inclusion scheme would be defeated if a large number of farmers are deprived of their share of credit, Mr. Sambasiva Rao observed and suggested to the Reserve Bank of India AGM Hariharan to take necessary steps for meeting the targets. MLC K.S. Lakshman Rao said the objective of banks nationalisation should be borne in mind by the banks while reaching out to the masses. Collector S. Suresh Kumar said banks had lent Rs 2,386 crore to farm sector as against the targeted Rs. 2,196 crore during the kharif season. It was an achievement of 108 per cent. A sum of Rs. 682 crore was disbursed compared to Rs. 1,464 crore that was targeted during the Rabi season. Additional Joint Collector K. Sarada Devi, Andhra Bank DGM K. Venkateswarlu, NABARD AGM M.

He was addressing members of the Karnataka Small-scale Industries Association (KASSIA) here on Saturday and responding to their grouse that the facility was inaccessible immediately after the deadline, causing them hardship. He said 80,000 to a lakh e-Sugam numbers were generated every day in Karnataka, indicating the acceptance levels of the system. The 20th of every calendar month is not the first day to file the returns, it is the last day. Why should you wait till the last day? Mr. Tripathi asked. This prompted a member to suggest that the department consider offering incentives to early birds. However, the official felt this would eat into revenue collection and they would then have to devise other means to generate revenue. He said: By postponing the blocking action by five days, I feel half of the grouse against e-Sugam will vanish. He added that he had instructed officials to restore the blocked facility within 12 to 24 hours after the entrepreneur filed returns. Earlier, KASSIAs chairman of panel on commercial taxes Vijay Kumar Makal gave out a list of grouses of small and medium enterprises. Principal among them was the hardship pertaining to e-Sugam facility, which prompted Mr. Makal to accuse the local vat offices of misusing their authority to block the facility. There were instances of cheques being presented before the due date but not being deposited on time, leading to the facility being blocked, he said. He also urged the department to abolish the entry tax for machinery procured by SMEs from other States. This would help improve business, Mr. Makal said. He also urged the department to expedite refund of VAT. KASSIA president A. Vijayendranath was present.  Nearly a lakh e-Sugam numbers generated every day  OPEN",

With the adoption of this technologically advanced method, livelihood of the farmers would also be enhanced, Collector Ashish Kumar said here on Friday. Pointing out that the farmers could acquire this expertise from agriculture officials, he said that due to vagaries in climatic conditions, this new method would ensure a good yield as less amount of water is utilised. Since the system remains successful, the farmers could derive maximum benefits from it. Water level in dams is only 50 per cent and with the limited water resource, paddy cultivation could be taken up under the SRI method. Unlike other methods of cultivation, just 2.5 cm of water is required for the paddy field and the farmers could save 30 to 40 per cent water. To raise the crop, certified high-yielding paddy variety could be utilised, reliable sources from Department of Agriculture said. The average paddy crop area is 20, 000 hectares in the district. The usage of seeds per acre is only two kg under this method, whereas under irrigated method, the quantity of seeds for one acre is 16 to 20 kg. As for raising a nursery, only one cent of land is enough, sources added. The farmers have also been advised to adopt better management practices for land-levelling, spacing, method of single seedling and weeding by komo weeder (manual operation) and power weeder (mechanized operation).

But the magnificent and marvellous palaces of Chettinad, situated in typical rural settings in and around Karaikudi, have got the attention of film makers in European countries. A 250-odd French film group, which consists of film personalities in Mumbai, has come here for the shooting of a television film Ran,' a historical love-cum-adventure story of a French girl dated back to 18th century. Though many Tamil and Hindi films were shot in and around 96 villages of Chettinad in the recent past, otherwise known as Nagarathar villages, this is the first time that the bungalows have been opened up for an European group and of course it is a different experience for the rural folk, who witness the stunning stars including the heroine Milan Jampano, and hero Jean Hugues Anglado, of France dancing and acting along the streets and courtyards of Kanadukathan, Sarugani, Kothamangalam villages, which boasts of spectacular heritage buildings constructed around a century ago with the materials imported from Italy, Myanmar (then Burma), Belgium and England. The story revolves around a French girl in 1743, who was deported to French colony in Pondicherry in India as she was involved in a murder case in which she was an accused. She lands up in a jail and subsequently she meets a prince and marries her. After undergoing many traumatic experience including jail life, love and war, she goes back to France to prove her innocence in the case. While Alan Cleic produces the film Arnaud Selignac directs it and Jose Antonio Loureiro takes care of photography. Mumbai-based Kriti Production leads the film shoot in India. The team, which shot in Rajasthan for a while, will be in Karaikudi for three weeks. It is not just that the palace-like buildings in this part of India suits our historical story but they possess a lot of novel beauty to the world of cinema. They are truly remarkable and something special. We are impressed by the architecture of the bungalows. Many aspects of the buildings resemble French architecture, says Pierre Gauthier, sound engineer of the film.

Thus the Prison Department should organise job melas' in prisons. The MGCCs in Central and other major prisons, which were formally inaugurated by the Law Minister on Thursday, provides 15 types of vocational programmes such as diploma in Desk Top Publishing, Four Wheeler Mechanism, Home Appliances Repairing and Service, Computer Hardware Servicing, Apparel and Fashion Designing, Beautician, Catering etc. apart from regular educational programmes such as B.A., B.Sc., B.B.A. The diplomas and degree certificates would be issued by the Tamil Nadu Open University. Inter-personal relationships, computing skills, and internship would also be inculcated to them to fully prepare them to respectfully assimilate with society upon their release from the prison, he added. He told the prisoners to make the best use of the MGCC facility for betterment of their lives and as well of their family, he urged them to restrain from misusing the parole facility. Coming out on parole without any valid reason and committing an offence during parole would only put them in disadvantageous position as their petition for parole at a crucial junction in their life could be rejected.

With such strong head winds, the need is to find out whether HR is equipped to handle the associated factors such as cost cutting, lay-off and demands of the CEO, he said participating in a panel discussion at The Hindu Shine HR Conclave here on Friday. Besides serving as a networking forum, the event turned the spotlight on a host of issues confronting professionals in the backdrop of the economic slowdown, growing demands of management and a never-before need to retain talent. Cautioning against a cut and paste strategy as all corporates were not the same, Mr. Balaji said companies should consider recruitment process outsourcing (RPO). Though a large pool of talent was available, not many passed when put through a funnel, he pointed out. Rajeev Bhatnagar, Vice-President and Head-HR, Larsen & Toubro, said RPO should be looked at more as a tool for developing own competencies. A major challenge for companies engaged in research and development work, according to Arokia Sagayaraj, Head-HR, Renault Nissan Technology & Business Centre India P Ltd., was talent acquisition, and it was only going to get bigger. Moderating the discussion, Sandeep Bhushan, Vice-President, HT Media, said HR had come to be an important component of business. Lot had changed from one of lack of opportunities to lack of talent, and from IR (industrial relations) to employer branding. In his opening address, C. Sreetharan, Vice-President-HR, The Hindu , said HR function, per se, was going through a transition.

Yet another could not be implemented following an injunction issued by the Chalakudy Munsiff Court, G. Suseelan, managing director, NGIL, told reporters. He said that the Chief Ministers Office, Kerala State Pollution Control Board and the expert committee were being apprised of the progress in implementing the directives. Two additional secondary bag filters have been installed in the Di Calcium Phosphate plant. Two driers have been installed for drying the sludge generated. The dried sludge, a manure, is being sold as a branded product named, Nutrisoil. Efforts are being taken to prevent odour emanating from the area where bones are crushed. This area has been fully covered. A bio-filter has been installed in the plant using technology and design evolved at the National Institute of Inter Disciplinary Sciences, Thiruvananthapuram, he said. The NGIL claimed to have established a green belt in association with Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI). In the first phase of a three-year project, the NGIL planted 2,500 trees on its premises. The NGIL plans to install an online ambient air monitoring system. A public display system installed at NGIL shows the pH of water discharged into the river. A flow meter for continuous monitoring of water intake from the river has also been installed. A pollution monitoring committee including local body members, trade union representatives and officials of the Health Department has been formed. Its first meeting, chaired by B.D. Devassy, MLA, was held on February 27, 2012. Members of the Action Council, and president and vice-president of the Kadukutty panchayat boycotted the meeting, he said.  OPEN",

It should be paid as a lump sum within two weeks, the court said. K.Sambath alias Chidambaranathans case was that his wife, Malathi (47), a daily wage earner, went to a farmland at Vinayagampattu on May 17, 2009 to fetch grass for cattle when the tragedy occurred. He said the live wire was lying on the ground due to the negligence of the Puducherry Electricity Board. He sought compensation for her death. Boards contention The boards Superintending Engineer-I, submitted that the electric line snapped as a casuarina tree fell on it due to heavy wind. The Electricity department periodically inspected and maintained the electric lines. In spite of such action, sometimes accidents occurred which was beyond the departments control. Avertable Justice N.Paul Vasanthakumar said the tragedy could have been averted if the department had taken precautionary measures. Hence, the board and the government were vicariously liable to pay compensation to the petitioners family which consisted of three members. As the cause of death was admitted and negligence proved, the authorities could not escape the liability of paying compensation to the petitioners family. In the light of various decisions of the Supreme Court and the High Court, and in the circumstances of the case and having regard to the death of the woman at the age of 47, Mr.Justice Paul Vasanthakumar said that he was allowing the petition with a direction to the authorities to pay a compensation of Rs.four lakh to the petitioners family. Of the sum, the petitioner was entitled to Rs.one lakh and his two sons Rs.1.50 lakh each. The Judge posted the matter for January 21 for reporting compliance of the order.

        "content": " With winter setting in, there is some respite in power cuts for the domestic sector. This year the power scenario had been so bleak that even in November, power cuts were common and on commercial and industrial use load ceiling was imposed. But alternative energy sources are becomingly increasingly available and gaining ground because of their efficacy. Apart from individual residences, even apartments can go in for solar power, says Rao S.Y.S. Chodagam, founder and managing director of Titan Energy Systems Ltd., of Hyderabad. Apartments can go in for solar panels for lighting in common areas like parking space, staircase. It will bring down the cost of maintenance for the flat-owners association. Besides individual apartments may also be energised for lighting a fan, a tube light, TV, computer system etc. as is being done with a traditional inverter. But the key factor here, says Mr. Rao, is the size of the rooftop. With increasing stress on space constructions are coming up in small plots but with as less as 10 units. Such constructions may not facilitate adequate roof size and installation of solar panels for individual units together. But the practice so far has been that solar photovoltaic modules are being purchased and flat owners are going in for alternative energy to overcome the power shortages. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy Sources is offering a 30 per cent subsidy for installing solar power. Mr. Rao says now it is possible to take up the installation of solar power with expenditure only limited to the 70 per cent of the cost. But the apartment owners have to get the internal wiring done. It is possible to take up the 10,000 systems to Rs.100 crore project. If someone is spending about Rs. 1 crore on a building, getting installed a system costing Rs.4 lakh will stand him in good stead. For a flat of Rs.30 lakh to Rs.40 lakh it will cost about Rs.1 lakh but he can save about 150 units a month, Mr. Rao estimates. 1 Apartments may also be energised for lighting a fan, a tube light, TV, computer system etc. as is being done with a traditional inverter  2 Apartments can go in for solar panels for lighting in common areas like parking space, staircase      OPEN",

The work of the Cochin State Tramway that was started under the direction of then Kochi King Ramavarama Raja in 1901 was completed by 1905.

Though it was launched for bringing logs from Parambikkulam forest, it was a major mode of transport to the forest region. It was de-commissioned in 1963. Now only five per cent of the remains of the tramway is available in Kerala.

The MSO (multi-system operator) is already the biggest in the State outside of Chennai, and has set up a digital head-end in the city on its operational premises in Nungambakkam using equipment it moved from its head-end in Vellore. Its managing director D.Vivekanandan claimed that 1,100 local cable operators with a subscriber base of 14 lakh in the city had already signed up with the MSO and it had placed its initial order for the procurement of 50,000 digital set-top boxes. But the company is a bit perplexed by the delay in the issue of licence to commence operations in Chennai under DAS. The managing director and his associates had even been invited by the Ministry in June to discuss the plans for the DAS rollout  initially intended in mid-year and later extended to October 31. There is a U-turn in the approach of the Ministry towards Arasu Cable in recent weeks, the managing director added. More recently, the TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) put out an internal letter to the Ministrys secretary recommending that the policy framework be put in place to ensure that government or government-owned entities be not allowed to enter into the business of broadcasting and or distribution of TV channels. Arasu Cable TV was originally started by the previous DMK regime soon after then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi fell out with his grand-nephews, the Maran brothers. It was then seen as a move to curb the influence and reach of Sumangali Cable Vision, a multi-system operator, in the cable distribution sector. However, the company was revived by the AIADMK after it came to power. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has said the decision to revive the company was to end monopolistic practices in the sector and benefit consumers.

        "content": " Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan on Saturday called upon the government to take over all lease-violated and expired government land, including that of Harrisons Malayalam and the Tatas, and distribute it to the landless. Inaugurating a seminar on Land reforms and the new approaches organised as part of the birth centenary celebrations of freedom fighter and the late Communist leader E.P. Gopalan at the Town Hall here, Mr. Achuthanandan accused the United Democratic Front (UDF) government of sabotaging the Land Reforms Act. By allowing conversion of five per cent of plantation land, the government is allowing Harrisons Malayalam to covert 3,000 acres of plantation land for tourism and other purposes. This is a violation of the Land Reforms Act that did not put any ceiling on the plantation land. By allowing five per cent conversion of the plantation land, big landholders are given another exemption from the land reforms Act, he said. Mr. Achuthanandan said the government should takeover all lease expired and lease violated forestland at the Nelliampathy Hills in Palakkad. He said a sub-committee constituted by the UDF on the issue did not have legal sanctity as the matter was in the court. To sabotage the cases in the court, the UDF had constituted a sub-committee on Nelliampathy, he said. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) had taken steps to take over the forest lease expired and violated land at Nelliampathy. But the UDF government had stalled that process and was trying to hand over the estates that had been taken over by the LDF government. He said the intervention of government Chief Whip P.C. George in Nelliampathy was to thwart the actions of the Forest Department to resume the lease violated estates. Answering a query on the treatment of PDP leader Abdul Nasir Maudany in the Bangalore jail, Mr. Achuthanandan said he should get justice as an undertrial and a sick person. The seminar was presided over by V. Chamunni, president, Kisan Sabha.

There is no truth in Mr. Umamaheswara Raos allegation that large-scale defections from the Congress are in the offing, Mr. Rajeswara Rao told a press conference. Autocratic He also criticised TDP leader Bonda Uma Maheswara Raos charge against Congress MLAs Mr. Vishnu and Yallampalli Srinivas. Calling the district TDP chief a dictator, he said his autocratic rule had led to the exit of his party leaders Chinnam Ramakotaiah from Nuzvid, Nani from Gudivada, and Uppuleti Kalpana, who joined the YSRCP. The TDP leader must think of measures to check defections from his party. He owes an answer to people on his continuance in the party led by N. Chandrababu Naidu, who had back-stabbed NTR, he said.

Ramathal. The elected women representatives in the local bodies should also show more involvement in the development works being undertaken in their respective areas if they have to strengthen their presence and justify the enhancement of reservation to 50 per cent of total seats from 2011 local body elections in the State, she said. Ms. Ramathal was speaking at a conference on Greater participation of women in local bodies', organised by the Federation of Women Elected Representatives, Avinashi-based NGO Centre for Social Education and Development (CSED) and Chennai-based The Hunger Project, here on Friday. Powers Though a majority of the participants, who attended the conference, wanted the powers of removing the panchayat presidents to be taken away from the District Collectors, Ms. Ramathal was of the opinion that such powers should stay as it would keep the elected representatives more responsible and accountable. I am of the opinion that the other elected representatives like MPs and MLAs should also be brought under similar rules, she said. She called upon the elected women representatives to maintain a data bank of all womenfolk in their respective jurisdiction so as to effectively prevent sexual exploitation and girl trafficking. N. Markandan, former Vice-Chancellor of Gandhigram Rural University, said that the very purpose of Panchayat Raj system of governance was getting thwarted as the political power had not been meaningfully decentralised. This is happening because the political parties ruling the States were actually controlling the panchayat administration, he added. Funds He reiterated the need to properly allocate the Central and State government funds to the panchayats and stop using the funds earmarked to the local bodies towards implementation of State-sponsored schemes at the grass root level. The meeting passed a resolution requesting the State Government to allocate greater percentage of the State revenue coming from taxes towards the civic bodies and steps for helping women elected representatives to function fearlessly, among other demands. The CSED director, C. Nambi, elected representatives from 69 village panchayats under Tirupur, Avinashi and Sulur panchayat unions, and members of various women organisations, attended.  OPEN",

This is a technical issue and the Reserve Bank of India is seized of the matter. Efforts are being made to resolve the issue as soon as possible, said the Foreign Office.

It is a significant action, he had told the Wall Street Journal. Under the ACU mechanism, third countries find it difficult to trace transactions by companies because the settlements are made by the Central banks of the member countries.

This will require multi-pronged action, including cutting emissions, an efficient and clean energy policy and planting many trees, the former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has said. He was speaking after inaugurating the silver jubilee celebrations of the South India chapter of the Organisation for Industrial Spiritual and Cultural Advancement (OISCA) here on Friday. Dr. Kalam recalled how, when he came to Karukutty panchayat in July 2010 to inaugurate the second phase of the Haritha Kerala movement, he was impressed by the enthusiasm of the youth in forwarding the green programmes. I realised that Kerala may become a role model for many States and nations in the green mission, coupled with the mission of smart waterways from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod, he said. Every school in the State should encourage a garden inside the campus; something that is the result of the initiatives of teachers and students. That will serve multiple purposes, including instilling in children a love for growing plants, vegetables and flowers, learning how to work in a team and contribute to environment and society. A well-considered model of school gardens of Kerala may turn out to be a model of literary state of Kerala, he said. India occupied only 2.4 per cent of the world land area, but its contribution to world biodiversity was 8 per cent of the total number of species. The nation had 10 distinct biodiversity zones. More than 19 per cent of the nation's land area was covered with forests. This had to increase to 30 per cent. Even Indian deserts had more than 1,200 species of animals. The question India needed to ask itself was how could this bio-diversity be preserved, enhanced and be a strength for the nation, Dr. Kalam said. The bio-diversity of the nation and all its States can be a core competency, which can be the basis of achieving a triangular growth mission of ecological conservation, societal empowerment and economic development. This is the need of the hour, Dr. Kalam said. Later, Dr. Kalam presented the Vriksha Bandhu' award to Forest Minister Benoy Viswom.   OPEN",

The package would include new education facilities for children in the area and other physical amenities required for the development of the region, he added. The project details were prepared under the leadership of District Collector P.B. Salim after holding discussions with the natives. \\Both the State government and the Union Ministry of Defence would provide funds for implementing the package. Industrial parks Mr. Karim said the State government would soon take steps to start defence-related industrial parks to tap the potential of the shipbuilding unit at Chaliyam. Setting up of these special parks would play a significant role in supplying native brand of products, required for research and development activities in the field of shipbuilding, he said. To benefit students According to Mr. Karim, the opening of NIRDESH would be benefit students pursuing various courses in naval architecture. The Department of Naval Architecture under Cochin University has already expressed its gratitude to the Union Ministry of Defence and the State government for pioneering such an initiative at Chaliyam, he said.

The institute has also won the meritorious invention award instituted by the National Research Development Corporation, India, for the same technology. The award comprises a purse of Rs.5 lakh. Developed by a team led by V.B. Manilal of the Process Engineering and Environmental Technology division during 2004-07, the microbial process for production of white pepper enables easy removal of skin from black pepper. Other team members were Ajit Haridas and Gopinathan M. The microbial process uses enzymes to degrade pectins, the cementing tissues present in between the skin and oil glands on the pepper kernel. It is claimed to be simpler, more cost-effective, pollution-free and faster than the conventional method of mechanical stripping or chemical treatment. The process also yields methane gas as a by-product. There are nine production plants set up in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu based on this technology. NIIST has also licensed the technology to another six small and medium enterprises. The skin-removed pepper generally known as the white pepper' is preferred to black pepper in most food preparations. The current annual demand for white pepper exceeds 100,000 tons. The traditional retting method for production of white pepper followed by global suppliers, particularly Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brazil, compromises on the quality of pepper.

        "content": " : The former President A.P.J Abdul Kalam inaugurated the 78 {+t} {+h} Sivagiri pilgrimage session on Friday with a fervent call to pilgrims to resolve to be righteous citizens and promote afforestation and literacy. Every person should resolve to be a righteous citizen so that his heart and character will gain beauty and set his home, nation and world in peace and order. There should be a firm resolve to work and succeed with integrity. He called upon the pilgrims to vow to do something that would make their life worthy and memorable. They should plant 10 trees and educate at least five illiterate persons. Such activities will make their life as well as society, the nation and the world a better place to live. The pilgrimage is a symbol of five purities of human life  body, word, mind, food and deed. This, indeed, is the vital step towards the evolution of better individuals, better families, better cities, better nation and a better world. The inspiration for such a great mission is derived out of a very noble soul, Sree Narayana Guru, he said. The Guru, who rose from the ranks, shook off the shackles that impeded the free expression of his spirit and brought back to the minds of the people the real message of Advaita through his philosophy, one caste, one religion, one God for man. The message Ask not, say not, think not caste' is significant in unifying societies of the world, he said. Forest Minister Benoy Viswom, in his presidential address, said the Guru was not just another sanyasi who rooted his philosophy in salvation of man in another world, but offered practical solutions to the problems faced by man in his daily life. This made him a revolutionary. His definition of Advaita was sharp and lucid. The blind worship of money and wealth of late is a threat to society. The Guru's philosophy is the only reply to such problems, he said. Union Minister for Overseas Indian Affairs Vayalar Ravi said the increasing trend of addiction to liquor in the State was a matter of concern. The rate of liquor consumption in the State was really alarming. The statistics being published in the media make one think that Keralites are consuming only liquor. The ideals of the Guru should be implemented in life to practise abstinence, he said. Sree Narayana Dharma Sanghom Trust general secretary Swami Rithambarananda welcomed and delivered the pilgrimage message. A huge procession was taken out in the morning.  OPEN",

It was decided at a meeting of officials in the Collectorate here on Saturday to urgently tackle drinking water shortage and drought-like situation in the district. The KWA officials told the meeting that the water level at the Pazhassi reservoir could not be maintained above 15 metres because of the ongoing repairs on the barrage across the river. The proposal for temporary embankment was discussed when the KWA officials said that the lowering of the water level at the reservoir might lead to severe water shortage in the district. MLAs A.P. Abdullakutty, K.K. Narayanan, and Sunny Joseph were present at the meeting. Mr. Narayanan said that measures would be taken by the district administration to tackle the possible shortage of drinking water in rural areas. Mr. Joseph called for an action plan to meet a drought-like situation. Planning should be decentralised and every action should be followed up, he added.

The children have the right to life, grow, get protection, and participate, he added. The objective of the wing is to ensure the fundamental rights of children.

Besides, differently abled children, drug-addicts, HIV-infected, destitute, roadside children, abducted ones, and children abandoned by parents would be rescued and their rights would be restored to them through the Child Welfare Agency. In addition, the children who have flouted law would also be rescued and extended new lease of life through the Juvenile Justice Board. The Collector said that it had been proposed to function in co-ordination with the District Social Welfare office in preventing child marriages. Besides, the district administration would act in unison with Childline too.

They gathered at Ganesh Maidan and walked to Ambedkar circle. They shouted slogans against the anti-labour policies of the Union and State governments and hailed the pro-labour organisations. At the public function, labour leaders called for a unified agitation of labourers and workers in various sectors to achieve the goal of an exploitation-free world. Successive governments at the State and the Centre have betrayed labourers by not ensuring minimum wages or job security, M.B. Nadagouda, state secretary of the CITU, said. Political parties have seen the labour class only as a vote bank and not as a target group that needs welfare measures, he added. He said it was ironical that governments that refused to ensure minimum wages for labourers were quick to increase wages and benefits of government employees. Akshara Dasoha workers, headload workers, gram panchayat staff and others have been wooed by various parties only for political benefit. Each government has assured of providing secured jobs and higher wages, but never kept these promises. Labour organisations have been fighting for these minimum rights for over four decades now. But they have not been fulfilled. Akshara Dasoha workers are the least paid in the State today. Several memoranda to Chief Ministers have gone unnoticed, he said. He demanded that the government drop the idea of appointing employees on contract in government departments. All departments should have only permanent employees and they should get all employee benefits, he said. He said that only democratic agitations could lead to employee welfare and that CITU would fight for the benefit of over five lakh headload workers and over one lakh Akshara Dasoha workers in the State. K. Neela, Janawadi Mahila Sanghatane vice-president, urged the working class to fight for justice.

Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Mr. Pawar said that the entire eight-hectare plot allotted for the zoo on Bangalore-Pune National Highway would be utilised and developed into a picnic spot. A few nests would be placed for birds and the existing cages, which were very small, would soon be replaced with larger ones.

The authority would soon release Rs. 35 lakh in the first phase for its development. Similarly, the zoo in Bellary would be developed at an estimated cost of Rs. 80 crore of which the government had recently released Rs. 8 crore. Except Mysore, Bannerghatta, near Bangalore, and Shimoga, the zoos in other places were not in a good condition and not generating sufficient revenue to meet their routine expenses, he said.

He was questioned for nearly 10 hours on Friday. They have asked me to come again for another round of interaction, Mr. Ramalingam told The Hindu here on Saturday after returning from Chennai. Forty-minute break I-T officials had questioned him from 11.50 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. In between, they gave me a 45-minute break to take lunch and provided me tablets to bring down my fever, he said. He refused to divulge details of questions posed by the officials. The officials were polite despite bombarding him with questions, he said. Mr. Ramalingam was disappointed that the I-T officials did not allow his lawyers to accompany him during the questioning. When contacted, I-T department sources told The Hindu that it was not an interrogation and only a fact-finding session where he was only asked about the sources of income, and no points of law were involved. In such cases, lawyers cannot be allowed inside, they said. Mr. Ramalingam claimed that he had filed I-T returns for two years for his company Baranidhar Refinery Private Limited. He claimed that he had two companies  Vallinayagi Traders and Baranidhar Refinery. Baranidhar Refinery was registered with the Registrar of Companies. He was unable to file I-T returns for Vallinayagi Traders and Commission Agencies for the last four years. The trader said he had rented out a portion of his land adjacent to his house at Dharapuram to a petrol bunk. The petroleum company had not given the TDS (tax deducted at source) certificate for the last four years for the rental and hence, he was unable to file the I-T returns for Vallinayagi Traders. Did not try to encash bills Mr. Ramalingam said he had a PAN card and had never made any attempt to encash the bills of exchange.

The service offers eight tests at Rs. 85 and the process takes a fraction of time it normally does in diagnostic centres. Once the blood sample is collected, it is screened and while the results are stored locally on the slate that is an Android device, they are also pushed onto a cloud from where doctors and patients can retrieve the data at their convenience, said K. Srinath Reddy, President, PHFI. Dr. Reddy said the launch was a result of a joint initiative between the PHFI, MeeSeva and A.P. Government and would go a long way in handling the increasing problems of hypertension and diabetes that plagued a large section of the population in the State. The tests would be conducted by MeeSeva operators trained by PHFI. In Phase One, 15 of them underwent training, enough to provide the services at 10 MeeSeva centres. The second phase of training will start on Sunday and in a couple of weeks, the services would be available at 20 more centres in Hyderabad, it is learnt. The tests include blood pressure, blood sugar, haemoglobin, heart rate, water quality (total suspended particles in water), electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature and urine protein. All these tests can be done at 10 MeeSeva centres in Hyderabad at Rs. 85 and the same if done at diagnostic laboratories outside, cost anywhere between Rs. 1,100 and Rs. 1,500. It was launched by Principal Secretary, Health, Ajay Sawhney, in the presence of Principal Secretary K. R. Kishore and MeeSeva Director K. Gopinatha.

        "content": " Madurai district has a high infant mortality rate, with nearly 70 infant deaths recorded every month on an average. From April to November 2012, 528 infants died in the district. Of these, 111 deaths were reported in the corporation area alone. Infant death particulars gathered from the Health Department show that the district is losing over 700 infants almost every year since 2008-09. Interestingly, Melur municipality had no infant deaths in the last eight months while Tirumangalam municipality reported only two deaths during the period. We are taking all the necessary steps to bring down the infant mortality rate in the district. Round-the-clock medical attention for sick newborns and improving neonatal care are our top priorities, S. Senthilkumar, Deputy Director of Health Services, told The Hindu , on Friday. Out of the total 528 infant deaths recorded from April to November 2012, the number of deaths in rural areas was 415 as per data collected from 51 Primary Health Centres in the district. Madurai Corporation recorded 111 deaths while the remaining two deaths occurred in May last year in Tirumangalam municipality. Health Department officials said that 45 per cent of infants died within seven days of birth. Reasons cited in the medical records were birth asphyxia, sepsis, pneumonia, congenital anomaly, heart disease, low birth weight and milk asphyxiation. The first seven days are crucial for the baby and the maximum number of deaths happen during this time. The Collector is regularly doing infant death audit, a senior official said. Infant deaths reached 74 in October 2012. The month-wise break-up of infant mortality deaths recorded in the last eight months is as follows: April (56), May (46), June (60), July (36), August (49), September (42), October (74) and November (52). The figures for December are yet to be collected from the PHCs, officials said. The pockets where infant mortality is high include Karungalagudi, Melakkal, N. P. Kottai, Sedapatti, T. Pudupatti, Alanganallur, T. Kallupatti, Valayankulam, Chekkanoorani, Therkutheru, Kulamangalam and Tirupparankundram.  OPEN",

        "content": " : The 21-year-old Annai Indira Gandhi Bridge (Pamban bridge), an engineering marvel, connecting the island of Rameswaram to the mainland, would be renovated at an estimated cost of Rs 18.58 crore. After nearly a year-long search, the Public Works Department finalised a Chennai-based bidder Trinity & Co., for the project. Official sources said the agreement is expected to be one year, but the work would be completed in six months. The work included anti-corrosive painting, provision of strip seal expansion joints, finger joints, CC wearing course and crack sealing. The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had initially sanctioned an estimated Rs.13.89 crore in March last, but the PWD could not take up the work in the absence of a qualified bidder. A year had lapsed as bids were cancelled and re-invited till the PWD finalised Trinity & Co. As a year had lapsed after the Ministry gave its sanction, the PWD presented a revised estimate for Rs 19.95 crore based on current rates and the Ministry sanctioned the revised estimate for Rs.18.58 crore after making some modifications in the estimate. After the 2.345-km-long bridge was inaugurated by the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1988, it was repainted twice in 1990 and 2001-02, but to be renovated for the first time now, the sources said. The bridge, designed like a bow over the sea to allow ships to pass beneath, is supported by 79 pillars, 64 of which were built in sea. All the pillars would be have an anti-corrosive paint coat, the sources said. The splash zone of the spans, with a height of 3.36 meters would be painted with coal tar epoxy and the non-splash zone with a height of 5.1 meters would be painted with epoxy primer, the sources said. The entire bridge would be repainted at a cost of Rs.10 crore and the renovation at a cost of Rs.5 crore. As part of the repair work, all the 592 bearings in the spans would be replaced with prodding neoprene bearings. The bridge would have new 90 watt LED lights after replacing all the existing 174 electric poles.  OPEN",

        "content": " Bickering within the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal and the Badal family came to the fore once again when Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal publicly snubbed his son-in-law, Minister for Revenue and Public Relations Bikram Singh Majithia at the conclusion of the Parvasi Punjabi Sammelan at Jalandhar on Saturday. Mr. Mathija is the brother of the Akali MP from Bathinda, Harsimrat Kaur Badal. While the senior Badal is the patron of the ruling party, his son Sukhbir Singh is the president and Mr. Majithia, the president of the Youth Akali Dal. Till now, he was seen as the most influential person in the Akali hierarchy after the Badal father-son duo. In his typical colloquial eloquence that was laced with humour and satire, Mr. Badal reminded the gathering that though the organisers of the event had lauded him for becoming the Chief Minister for the fifth time, they conveniently avoided any mention of his 17 years of incarceration during his political career of over six decades. Mr. Majithia was floored when the Chief Minister suddenly asked him: Have you ever spent a day in jail? When he answered in the negative, Mr. Badal jibed:  Pakki pakayi mil gayi , hun kabza karan nu firdey ne [You have been served a prepared meal, now you want to grab it]. The venue, packed with NRIs, Ministers, present and former MPs and MLAs, party leaders and top bureaucrats fell silent at this. Earlier, Mr. Badal took a dig at his son who, while addressing the conclave, listed the achievements of the Akali Dal-BJP combine and sought to impress the NRIs that the alliance had returned to power on the performance card. In the present political scenario, nobody votes for performance. Electoral success is based on the capacity of the leader to win the confidence of the people. That is the reason I am here, Mr. Badal said. Responding to a plethora of demands and suggestions, especially those related to the streamlining of the departments dealing with NRI issues, the Chief Minister chuckled: If you want to get your genuine work done and in an efficient manner, I am the only single window or the darwaza [door] if you may say. Come to me or you are free to opt other means that would mean harassment. Incidentally, Mr. Majithia is also the Minister-in-charge of NRI affairs and played a key role in organising the sammelan . At the inaugural session on Friday, the State government agreed to form a high-level committee and also consider the demand for a one stop shop for NRIs facing problems on different counts. Under fire Mr. Majithia has received flak from various quarters in the recent past. The State Congress has been demanding his removal from the Cabinet for his alleged high handedness and for patronising anti-social elements to terrorise political opponents. After he was involved in an exchange of abusive words with Congress legislator Rana Gurjeet Singh, the Opposition boycotted the proceedings of the recently concluded winter session of the Assembly. In the Assembly, while speaking on the debate on law and order, leader of the Opposition Sunil Jakhar warned that the office of the Chief Minister had been hijacked, denigrated and usurped. Elements who resorted to high handedness had taken over, he alleged, otherwise incidents like [the] assassination of ASI Ravinderpal Singh in Amritsar, abduction of a girl from her house in Faridkot and [the] assault of a serving AIG of police [in] Ludhiana would not have taken place if the reins of the government were in Mr. Badals hands.

The pilgrims escaped near-stampedes more than once when the temple was opened in the afternoon of December 30 after being closed for three days following the Mandalam festival. The Rapid Action Force swung into action to manage the mammoth crowd. Poor planning and coordination among the police force at Pampa, the Sannidhanam and Nilackal has made the pilgrimage a miserable experience for many. The pilgrims coming from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have to wait for hours together inside the thickly packed barricades along the zigzag path leading to the Sannidhanam. Supply of drinking water and biscuits inside the barricades has gone haywire. The pilgrims taking the Karimala and Pulmedu paths have to face more difficulties as the eateries run by the eco-development committees of the Forest Department have been allegedly fleecing them. The camps run by the Akhila Bharatha Ayyappa Seva Sanghom at Azhutha, Karimala and Valiyanavattom, which supply free food and drinking water, have been a solace to the weary pilgrims. Anti-social elements had drained the main water tank of the Sanghom at Karimala a few weeks ago. Neither the Forest Department nor the district administration has made any inquiry into the vandalism and taken steps to supply water to the pilgrims visiting the camp. The authorities have failed to provide any basic facilities to the scores of pilgrims coming through the Pulmedu route, which has been seeing a rising pilgrim inflow. Though the Sanghom has been running a camp at Uppupara on the Pulmedu route for the past several years, the Forest Department is yet to give clearance for it this year. The surrounding forest tract is likely to witness an unprecedented crowd for worshipping the Makarajyoti on January 14. The spurt in the pilgrim inflow is in spite of the ban on vehicle entry beyond Kozhikkanam in the backdrop of the stampede of 2011.  OPEN",

Each unit has a big yard to dry fish and decaying wastes of fish brought from seashores of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The units are clearing their pending stock and are also shifting their machinery.

Addressing a meet-the-press programme organised by the Press Cub here on Saturday, the Minister said tha though the government was obliged to revise electricity tariff every year, the existing crisis in the power sector might lead to a possible hike in tariff, though the government would explore all avenues to avert the hike. The government was also taking measures to tide over the power shortage caused by excess consumption, he said. They included introduction of solar panels in 10,000 households at a subsidised pilot project, LNG-based power generation at the National Thermal Power Corporation plant at Kayamkulam and the proposed LNG plant at Cheemeni. The Minister said the water level in reservoirs was only 45 per cent of what it had been during this time last year. The power consumption recorded an annual 10 to 12 per cent increase as the average consumption had increased from nearly 42 million units last year to 56 million units now. The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) required Rs.770 crore for power purchase, while its total revenue was Rs.700 crore, he said adding that the board was incurring a monthly loss of Rs.200 crore. The crisis was so serious that the board would not be able to purchase power and get finance from banks, he said. The Minister said that though the State was getting 300 MW of power from unallotted quota from the Central pool with the active support of Union Minister of State for Power K.C. Venugopal, efforts would be taken to get more from the pool. Mr. Mohammed said the State's daily power requirement was expected to be 6,000 MW by 2020 as against the current requirement of 3,400 MW.

Laying the stone for the university, he said the Centre would give thrust to enhance excellence in higher education during the 12th Five Year Plan period as the standards of education had gone down steadily over the years. Only an education that promotes creativity, application, and effective communication will survive the test of time. The fast pace of growth of information technology has made a total revamp of the matter and manner - content and delivery  of our education system inevitable, he said, expressing hope that the CUK would strive to meet that goal. Holistic approach Mr. Raju said he believed that the CUK had a vision that catered to a holistic approach ensuring total quality management and capacity building. Terming the foundation laying ceremony as a historic occasion for the CUK, the Minister said the first set of buildings on the 310-acre campus would be ready by the next academic year. Addressing the gathering, Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development Shashi Tharoor stressed the need to enhance employability of young talent in tune with the requirement of emerging job markets. Mr. Tharoor, who unveiled the master plan of the university, expressed hope that the CUK would be a centre of excellence and able to attract faculty and students from across the nation. Expressing concern at the fall in standards of higher education, Mr. Tharoor said none of the universities in the country figured on the list of top 200 such institutions in the world. He said while reputed universities gave importance to continuous research, the universities in India were becoming mere study centres. There is an urgent need to increase the research component in our institutions and the CUK should strive to increase research works, he said. Chief Minister Oommen Chandy promised all cooperation of the State government for the CUK. He said the government was committed to providing basic infrastructure for the expansion of the CUK. The government would expedite steps to provide additional land for the university. Union Minister E. Ahamed, Education Minister P.K. Abdu Rabb, P. Karunakaran, MP, K. Kunhiraman, E.

The bridge, work on which began in 2010, will connect Thiruporur to Nemmeli on East Coast Road (ECR). The structure is being constructed as part of the tsunami rehabilitation programme. K. Sivaraman a resident of Thiruporur said that at present, residents who wanted to get on to ECR have to first go to Kelambakkam to reach Kovalam, or travel to Poonjeri near Mamallapuram. The distance between these two areas  Kelambakkam and Poonjeri is 21 km. Work on the bridge has been progressing very slowly. If it is speeded up, it would immensely help residents of this area, he said. More bridges are also coming up as part of the same project  two bridges in Mamallapuram on the Thirukazhukundram Road, one across backwaters and another across Buckingham Canal at a cost of Rs. 4 crore; one at Thazhuthaali Kuppam at Rs. 6 crore across Buckingham Canal and another at Kadapakkam at Rs. 6.23 crore. P. Kuppusamy of Kadapakkam said the Kadapakkam bridge led to the Alambara Fort, an important tourist attraction on ECR. Eight years have gone by after the tsunami of 2004. But work that is supposed to be part of the tsunami rehabilitation programme is yet to be completed. This bridge will replace an exiting old bridge. If it comes up, Alambara can also be developed, he said. A source in the Highways Department said that by June, all five bridges would be completed.

Now, it finds itself in the news for another reason  a proposed airport. The district administration has demarcated thousands of acres of land for the airport, and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has given its green signal for the project. Meanwhile, people organised under the Anti-Airport Agitation Council have come out strongly against the move, and a mass blockade has been planned on Wednesday. The airport is to come up in seven wards of the Chakkupallom and Vandanmedu grama panchayats, in an area marked between Udumbanchola and Peerumade Assembly constituencies. As per government estimates, around 6,000 families have to be evicted in the land acquisition drive for the airport and its related development. People from the IMS Colony, Girijan Colony, Sulthankada Colony, Naduvanakkara, and Keezhanakkara will have to be evacuated, in addition to a large number of farmers, including those of Tamil origin who have been settled here for years. No place to go Where should we go from this traditional colony, where we have resettled from the forest area? asked Gracy, an 80-year-old tribalwoman from IMS Colony. T.A. Joseph, chairman of the agitation council, told The Hindu that as per a report received by them through the Right to Information Act, the area to be acquired for the proposed airport was 4.5 km in length and 4.7 km in width. The main area to be acquired included paddy fields with perennial water sources, he said, adding that the wetlands here were the main drinking water source for Kumily town, in addition to the diversion of the main stream from here to Kochera, then to Erattayar and the Idukki reservoir. About 40 per cent of land to be acquired for the proposed airport is paddy fields, and the rest includes cardamom, pepper, coffee and vegetables cultivations, along with residential areas, he said. The claim by authorities that just an airstrip was planned on the proposed land and only 500 acres of land would be acquired was to cool down the strong opposition, he said. However, the agitation council had begun its campaign, distributing copies of the accessed report to the people. The government has no alternative plan to rehabilitate the large number of people here, and those uprooted will be neglected once the project is realised. We will fight to the end against it, he said. The proposed airport is expected to promote tourism, but how can one promote tourism by destroying a beautiful hill anda scenic village, asked T.G.

It is not merely constructing buildings after buildings as we get more funds; we have a dream of how the university will look not just in another five or ten years but probably a century from now, and the fundamental ethos of the master plan is a green campus, she says. The university will strive to work to preserve the unique biodiversity through a concerted campaign outside the campus, Dr. James told The Hindu here. Green is not merely about environment. It is a philosophy of leading a healthy and friendly living. It is about making optimal use of the resources available for building up the campus without spoiling the environment. Before commencing any kind of project, including academic, we will have a green auditing on whatever we do on the campus to ensure that they do not interfere with the health of the people and the purity of the place or lead to pollution, she said. By green, we mean not merely planting trees; it is about healthy and friendly living and the initiative will be made by involving everybody on the campus, she said. She said the students should be taught on the need to respect the forces of nature to help them lead a healthy and sustainable life. The curricula of the university had been so designed that every student would be taught the values of caring wisdom or concern for fellow human beings.

The department had sought permission to put up scaffolding at a height of more than 7 metres so that vehicular flow would not be interrupted. Traffic flow will not be affected during the work. We need just two days to complete painting, said an official. We have been waiting for permission for more than a week now. If we dont get it soon, we might have to station a crane near the other arch to get the work done. This would be costly and time consuming, the official said. After two-month-long repair works, the Anna Arch has now been uncovered and illuminated. The restoration work is complete. The site has to be cleaned up and the cement concrete base built to hold the steel cribs has to be removed, the official said.  The pedestal between the twin arches on which the statue of former Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai stands has been given a fresh coat of paint. Close to Rs. 60 lakh was spent on restoring Anna Arch which was on the verge of demolition to make way for a Rs. 117-crore flyover.  OPEN",

Sharing the dais along with her disciples, Ms. Pullamamba expressed her happiness over participating in such a meeting. Recalling her memories with the school and college, she said she was exited to see her old students. She called upon students to follow ethical values and principles and become good human beings. Felicitation Prof. Srirama Rao said that his entire batch of friends felt very proud of their friend Adi Murthy on receiving Padmasri from President of India and added that he is a dedicated Scientist who is still travelling on a bicycle from his home to office in Trivandrum.

        "content": " I had my early training on the mridangam at the age of four, first under my cousin P.A. Venkatraman, and then with the legendary mridangam maestro, Palani Subramania Pillai. I fondly reminisce the days when the inimitable Palghat Mani Iyer listened to my playing when I was barely seven years old and blessed me. Having been trained in the traditional gurukula system, I made my debut at an Alathur Brothers' concert, with Lalgudi G. Jayaraman (violin) and I played in tandem with my guru Palani. Since then I had the rarest honour and privilege of performing duos with my guru for seven years for many top rank artists of the time including Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and others. I was able to imbibe Palani sir's style (the Pudukkottai bani) that was known for delectable designs of patterns, laya-oriented mohras and korvais and gumuki techniques through exemplary training which enabled me to embellish further and to imprint my own style over the years. I believe it is this individual artistry that has earned recognition for artists from different traditions and not mere imitation. When I was at the pinnacle of my concert career, Jon B. Higgins invited me to teach at York University, Toronto, Canada. We founded the Indian Music Program in 1971. This was left entirely under my direction after Jon left Toronto in 1978. My training as a postgraduate of Madras University alongside my performance career enabled me to slip into teaching and research. In the last 39 years at York University, I have trained several hundreds of students in the history, theory and performance of Indian music, many of whom have become professional performers and educators over the years. It was gratifying to be honoured with a doctorate in music by The University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, in 1998 and earlier with the coveted OCUFA (Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Association) award for teaching excellence. My interest for collaboration with world music artists resulted in many new creations with noted world musicians in the genres of Western Chamber music, Symphony, Jazz, African, Indonesian and other ensembles. Noted among these are, the  alpha Tai Chi Tala' which I introduced in 1973, embodies the culmination of three different cultures, Indian, Chinese and North American. Professor Trichy Sankaran is a percussion virtuoso, Indian music scholar and composer, and the founding director of Indian music studies at York University.  OPEN",

The districts to be covered under this new proposal are Tiruvallur, Tiruvannamalai, Thanjavur, Pudukottai, Dharmapuri, Villupuram, Ariyalur, Vellore and Tirupur, sources at the Directorate of Social Defence, the nodal agency for ChildLine in Chennai, told The Hindu. The project will be implemented under the Integrated Child Protection Services Scheme. ChildLine was launched in Chennai way back in April 1999, followed by the second city Coimbatore in December that year. Subsequently, other districts were covered  Salem, Tiruchi, Madurai, Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari, Nagapattinam, Cuddalore, and Mahabalipuram (Kancheepuram district). The process of identifying non-governmental agencies to serve as nodal agencies, collaborative agencies and supporting agencies has already begun, according to Vijay of the ChildLine India Foundation. The process would involve sending a recommendation of two agencies willing to take up the work to the CIF, which would then make the decision. There are two models that are followed  district and city, Mr. Vijay explained. While the first covers the entire district, the latter focuses on the urban centre alone, such as Chennai or Coimbatore, considering the range of problems and huge demand for such services. The team capacity and telecom services are also limited to this area, he said. Nationally, according to CIF data, the bulk of calls come in for emotional support and guidance for children. In the period April 2008- December 2008, it was 27 per cent. The next big chunk is for restoration, or taking lost/runaway children back home, followed by calls for medical assistance, shelter and sponsorship in that order. A significant portion of the calls also come in for requests for scholarship. Anuradha Vidyashankar, head, Southern Regional Resource Centre, added that usually the trends in a city follow the previous year's more or less, with few minor differences. The total number of calls has been coming down over the years, Ms. Vidyashankar said, primarily because BSNL is no longer the only telecom provider as it was when the project started. While the calls are toll-free on BSNL (1098), they will be charged if the calls come on other networks, and this could be one reason for the drop in the number of calls, she reasoned. However, efforts are on to strike up partnerships with other private telecom operators to ensure that the toll-free nature of the service is maintained. Another reason for the drop in the number of calls could be due to the slow disappearance of public phone booths, she added. Mr. Vijay explained that the aim was to get all the nine centres functional by March 2011. The nodal centres will be academic institutions, non-governmental institutions with the requisite capacity or the government, he added.  OPEN",

        "content": " It is the humble nut that is the villain of the piece here. Areca nut (or betel nut) is the established cause of a potentially cancerous condition of the mouth  Oral Submucous Fibrosis. OSF  in very lay terms is progressive stiffening of the cheek, leading to restricted mouth opening and tongue movements and with a high possibility of becoming cancerous. It is primarily caused by chewing areca nut, R. Gunaseelan, trustee, Chennai Dental Research Foundation (CDRF), says. Every dentist sees a number of cases on a daily basis, he adds. The common presentations are burning sensation in the mouth when eating spicy/hot food, blisters, ulceration, dryness, and a leathery feeling. The more severe cases, involve difficulty in opening the mouth, and moving the tongue, primarily because the cheek loses its elasticity. The problem is that it has enormous cultural sanction in southeast Asia. It is freely available, cheap, and there is no taboo to consuming areca nut, he adds. W.M. Tilekeratne, professor of Oral Pathology, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, says a 2010 study showed that in India the average age is 21-30 years. This should set the alarm bells ringing, he adds. A study done by CDRF in Sriperumbudur indicated a 7 per cent prevalence of OSF, coinciding with easy availability of various forms of areca nut. The youngest user was 15 years old. Yet another study in Corporation schools showed that boys in the higher classes were frequently using areca nut, KSGA Nasser, principal, Government Dental College explains. Once OSF occurs, the dentist will try various means to treat, most of them with short-term effects. Surgery might provide relief for about 7 years Dr. Nasser adds. What is worse is that even if you stop the habit, the disease continues once it started. The best way is prevention, Dr. Gunaseelan adds. Cultural sanction of areca nut a problem   OPEN",

The government's optimism, sources said, hinged on two facts: one, most of the Opposition leaders who attended the Speaker's meeting on Friday, while not giving up on the demand for a JPC, all accepted that the budget session should run. Two, after Thursday's meeting with Bharatiya Janata Party leaders L.K. Advani and Sushma Swaraj, neither issued any negative statement. Taken together, these are being interpreted in Congress circles as signs of softening on the part of the Opposition. Sources added that Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who attended the meetings, renewed the offer of a special session of Parliament to discuss the 2G spectrum scam. Another idea floating in government circles is that the Opposition could be encouraged to discuss the issue when the President's Address to Parliament in the coming budget session is taken up for discussion, as it is assumed that the speech will include references to corruption. Ms. Kumar, who had met BJP leaders, along with Mr. Mukherjee and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Bansal on Thursday, and those heading the non-BJP parties on Friday, was optimistic that there would be a breakthrough by the time the budget session came around. Those who attended Friday's meeting included Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar (Nationalist Congress Party), Sharad Yadav (Janata Dal-United), M. Thambidurai (AIADMK), Nama Nageshwara Rao (Telugu Desam Party), Ajit Singh (Rashtriya Lok Dal), Dara Singh Chauhan (Bahujan Samaj Party), Basudev Acharia (CPI-M), Gurudas Dasgupta (CPI), Bhartruhari Mahtab (Biju Janata Dal). The leaders met in a very cordial, friendly and informal atmosphere and have decided to ensure that the next session runs without interruption, Ms. Kumar told journalists after the two and a half hour meeting, stressing that they have decided that they will sit together and find a solution. Describing the meeting as a step forward, she said that all those who had participated in the discussions had expressed the view that the next session should not be disrupted. However, Ms. Kumar said she will hold another meeting for the Trinamool Congress, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the National Conference, which were unable to attend the luncheon meeting.

Their demand is abolition of contract labour system and regularisation of sanitation workers who are employed under this system. The working group had also recommended that employees engaged in sweeping and sanitation work should be made permanent employees. The former Mayor Narayana, who was among the members of the working group, told The Hindu over phone from New Delhi that a delegation of 50 pourakarmikas, accompanied by A.H. Vishwanath, MP, and leaders of the Mysore Palike Pourakarmikas Association, met Minister for Labour and Employment M. Mallikarjun Kharge and Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Kumari Selja, recently, and apprised them of the urgency to implement the draft Bill. We have explained the difficulties of pourakarmikas. The meetings were fruitful and we are satisfied with their response. The delegation had urged them to implement the recommendations of the working group. The Ministers have promised to address our concerns, Mr. Narayana said. The 15-member working group was constituted by the Labour Ministry in consultation with the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. The group also had representatives from the Ministry for Urban Development, Planning Commission, and the International Labour Organisation, among others. The secretary, National Commission of Safai Karmacharis, was also associated with the group. In a report, a copy of which is available with The Hindu , the group felt that the practice of manual scavenging should be eradicated. In Mysore, over 1,500 pourakarmikas were working under the contract labour system. Nearly 140 contract workers were engaged in underground drainage maintenance. Mara, a leader of pourakarmikas in Mysore, who was in the delegation, demanded regularisation of services of sanitation workers and a ban on contract labour system. The working group had six meetings  from July 22, 2010 to July 5, 2011. It felt that legislation should be framed with clear terms and conditions for sanitation workers, including abolition of contract labour system. Mr. Narayan, who has been working for the empowerment of sanitation workers, said: It is perhaps for the first time that pourakarmikas from Mysore visited New Delhi in big numbers to highlight their concerns and draw the attention of the government. The group recommended that the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana be extended immediately to sanitation workers without waiting for the legislation. They also sought extension of welfare and social security schemes such as Janashree Bima Yojana. Other recommendations include a fund for sanitation workers, levy of sanitation cess by municipalities on house and property tax, and setting up of Sanitation Workers State Welfare Board in every State.

He was speaking after inaugurating a two-day international conference on Managing human resource at workplace at the SDM Institute for Management Development here. Mr. Padaki emphasised the need for offering jobs in BPOs to people from rural areas. With the ever growing web-based technology and companies offering online education, there was tremendous opportunity for educating the youth, he said. Mr. Padaki said human resource should be viewed as human infinite potential and not just as resource. With the increase in life expectancy, people were found extremely energetic, he said. These elderly resources are highly potential. By 2025, the world would not be recognised as developed in technology, as technology would be embedded in human life itself, he added. Earlier, N.R. Parasuraman, Director, SDM-IMD, welcomed the gathering. Conference Chair Mousumi Sengupta gave a brief introduction on the theme of the conference. Conference co-chair D. Nilanjan Sengupta was present. The two-day conference will see deliberations from experts. Over 250 paper presentations from academic and corporate areas from India and abroad will be made.  OPEN",

Delivering the ninth Nani Palkhivala Memorial lecture on Law and Dharma at SASTRA University here, Mr. Parasaran said the rule of law is Sarvajana Sukhino Bavanthu, i.e., everyone should be happy. Articles 19-2 and 26 of the constitution speak about morality. Moral is the foundation for laws and legislation is the voice of the people. He also stressed the importance of ethical conscience. Ethical foundation should not be forgotten, he added. Quoting the story of Manuneedhi Cholan, Parasaran said it is important that justice appears to have been done. Though it was a wrong verdict given by Manuneedhi Cholan from the point of view of law, as the calf came under the wheel of the chariot which had bells to alert people, and as the chariot was plying in a lane meant for royals and as it is the duty of the cow to protect the calf, Manuneedhi Cholan gave the verdict to do justice to the cow from the point of view of Dharma. T. S. Sivagnanam, Judge, Madras High Court, Chennai, said while it is the duty of the parliament and State legislatures to enact laws, Judges deliver judgements as per the laws.

The power tariff of streetlights is borne either by the municipal authorities or by the KSEB. T.E. Abdulla, municipal chairman, when contacted said the tariff for streetlights erected on road dividers were borne by the municipality. The remaining lights were taken care of by the KSEB, he said.

Anyway, the municipality would look into the matter, Mr. Abdulla said.

Its organisers are hopeful that the International Olympic Committee will take note of the games popularity. The previous editions of the tournament witnessed competitions between teams predominantly represented by Punjabis settled there. This year, at least 10 participating teams did not have a single player of Indian origin. The winners in the mens section received a cash prize of Rs.2 crore, while the runners and the team at the third position were awarded Rs.1 crore and Rs.51 lakh respectively. For the womens section, the prize money was Rs.51 lakh, Rs.31 lakh and Rs.21 lakh for the winners, the runners up and third position respectively. Nearly Rs.23 crore was spent on the tournament, of which the State provided just Rs.5 crore. The remainder was mopped up through sponsorships. The circle kabaddi or Punjab style, for which the World Cup was organised, is quite different from the national style. As the name suggests, it is played in a circular ground instead of the rectangular one as is the case in the national style. After a raider and a defender tag, it is the display of strength and skill of the two players from the opposite sides. While most matches did attract major crowds and saw dignitaries showing keen interest, womens contests had extra responsive audiences. Women players from Denmark, Scotland, Turkmenistan and the United States made many fans among the youth. The organisers at Sangrur were taken by a surprise when the audience that had watched the womens game melted away without waiting for the results of the mens game between India and Afghanistan. To ensure high sporting standards, the organisers used the services of the National Anti-Doping Agency. The Indian teams cleared the tests after a few anxious moments, but a player from Canada tested positive for banned performance enhancing substances. The event, which was used by the State, especially Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, was launched amid major extravaganza on December 1. The participation by Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, who had just returned from the cremation of former Prime Minister I.K. Gujral, had raised eyebrows. The closing ceremony too was marked by major fanfare, with top cine stars and celebrated pop singers performing on occasion. Apart from showcasing his ability to organise mega events thrice in a row, Mr. Sukhbir Badal made a major attempt to reach out to the people of the State by promoting a game that has been popular in the countryside for ages.

The wildlife board had earlier rejected it on the grounds that it would harm Asia's only sloth bear sanctuary, close to the plant's proposed site. The board has approved an attractive wildlife hardship allowance for forest guards and watchers, the Minister said after a meeting of the board.  OPEN",

When the Karnataka State Government Daily Wage Employees Union first made the demand for regularisation of services of daily wage workers in 2005, there were more than 17,000 of them on the roll and now the number has come down to around 14,000 as of the remaining some have retired and some died while in service. Union president Chandrashekhar Hiremath, who spearheaded the agitation of daily wage workers, said the 14,000 daily wage employees working in 24 government departments would be eligible to get all benefits enjoyed by the permanent staff, including pension. However, the 6,000 daily wage workers employed in urban local bodies, whose services would also be regularised, would not be eligible for pension benefits, Mr. Hiremath said. The same was the case with the daily wage employees working in boards and corporations. However, all benefits enjoyed by permanent employees working in the municipalities and boards and corporations would be extended to daily wage employees. Mr. Hiremath said the daily wage workers whose services would be regularised would also get the benefit of seniority of service from the date of entry into service. Although this provision had not been included in the Bill, which was passed in the Assembly, Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar promised to include it through an amendment on the Floor of the House following a plea by legislators.

A lineage to be proud of, a good set of accompaniments, a sabha that provides a homely ambience all of these, without doubt, are enablers but not guarantors. Well, the concert under review was that of Nanditha Ravi. Making a brisk start with  Pagavari , a lesser-heard varnam in Hamsadhwani, she moved on to another rare kriti of Annaswami Sastry,  Sri kanchi nayike  in Saveri, giving it a brief string of swara s. The first alapana for the evening was Sahana, whose identity was evident in the very opening phrase. However, despite containing pleasing phrases, poise and pauses, the alapana appeared somewhat mechanical. The kriti ,  Ee vasudha  was crisp and had a moderate embellishment of swara s. Next, Nanditha elaborated on Bhairavi ahead of the kriti  Chintayama , doing a competent job despite a small tonal lapse in the higher octave. Usha Rajagopalan provided excellent support on the violin, with good repartees for Nandithas swara s and a neat alapana of Sahana. Her Bhairavi alapana , however, seemed a little stretched and one thought it could have been shorter. Nanditha chose to sing neraval in the opening lines of the charanam but was not comfortable with the densely packed lyric of  Mangalakara mandahasa vadanam . It is tricky to sing neraval in such a context without resorting to minor displacement or odukkal of the sahitya ; Nanditha could not make much of an impact here though she scored well in the swara s. After a pacemaker in Sindhuramakriya, she chose Varali ( Eti janmamidi ) as the main raga for the evening. By this time, she looked settled, sang with assurance and scored well in the alapana , kriti and swara s which also included a few rhythmic patterns that were sung confidently and aesthetically. B. Sivaraman played a very brief tani but his supportive accompaniment through the concert established himself as a good team-player. Along expected lines, the focus of the post- tani session was on padam s and javali s. The Khamas javali served as a warm-up piece while Ghanam Krishna Iyers padam ( Tiruvotriyur Tyagarajan ) enlightened the listeners on the glory of this form of compositions; only, poor Sivaraman seemed a bit clueless in this song. The programme concluded with another javali in Poorvikalyani ( Nee matale mayanura ). Nanditha has many strengths but she has to work on improving her confidence on stage so that her spontaneity comes on view. Technically, her neraval was one aspect in which there was scope for improvement. The torch-bearer of a glorious tradition must go farther! (T.T.

CAG report on general and social sector says the non-availability of blood banks in rural areas is a cause of concern although Odisha State Integrated Health Policy, 2002 emphasised on ensuring availability and distribution of blood in rural areas. Fifty-seven blood banks in government sector were available at medical college and hospital, district headquarters hospital, special hospitals at Bhubaneswar and Rourkela and sub-divisional headquarters, the CAG said. It said 13 districts with population ranging between 3.12 lakh and 16.98 lakh were having only one government blood bank each at the district headquarters while remaining 17 districts were having two to four government blood banks. Stating that location of blood banks was largely urban-based, the CAG said, only four out of the remaining 24 other blood banks being managed by the public sector units, private and charitable bodies are located at block headquarters while remaining 20 blood banks are available either at district headquarters or urban areas. The State government attributed to unavailability of adequate number of blood banks to lack of trained personnel, constraints on space, utilisation of capacity of blood and blood products, non submission of required documents. It added that the available number of blood banks and 28 blood storage centres at the community health centre level were able to meet the blood and blood products requirement for the State.  The CAG, however, said, the reply of government was not tenable as the availability was less than the annual demand projected by the State Blood Transfusion Council in all the three years (2009 to 2011) and blood banks were absent in rural areas. CAG also indicated at shortage of blood units in the State. Annual average demand of blood in the State during calendar year 2009 to 2011 was 2.93 lakh units against which availability was 2.53 lakh units leading to annual average shortage of about 0.40 lakh units. It alleged blood banks were functioning without valid licence and renewal.  OPEN",

The celebrations are indeed privileged ones for us. We have painstakingly tried to restore and reflect the spirit of antiquity by restoring the church, said Fr. P.J. Lawrence Raj. New infrasatructure There have been a lot of creative endeavours for the celebrations. Attention has been given to maintain the historical heritage and meticulous planning has gone into adding new aesthetics to the church. The window panes in the church have been replaced with colourful stained glass from Thrissur. Miracles of Jesus or Stations of the Cross have been brought out well on the imported glass panes. The pews in the church have also been changed completely. On the wings on either side of the main alter, new pews have been put up. The pews, each costing Rs. 35,000, have been sourced from Tindivanam Industrial School run by Montford Brothers. About 700 people can attend the mass at the chapel now, said the Parish priest. The wings, right and left side of the church have been extended by nearly 9 feet to seat more people. This has also facilitated the authorities to build new corridors to accommodate seven statues including St. Jude (second patron of the church); St. Antony, St. Alphonsa, Pieta (Mother Mary holding the body of Jesus Christ) and Mother Mary. Roofing and Bell tower The main altar, which was just a wooden structure, has now been replaced with marble. According to Fr. Lawrence Raj, the old crucifix is being used on a new wooden cross in the Church. Ramps have been created to make the church more accessible to the elderly. There will be no more hymn books as the hymns will be shown on an LCD monitor. The sound system too has been replaced, he added. The ceiling and the walls have been lined with wooden panels. In the centre of the ceiling the picture of holy spirit has been engraved in glass mosaic. On wooden panels around it, holy spirts, which signify the Litergical symbols pertaining to the holy mass rituals that take place in the church, have been engraved. Above the Tabernacle, an opening has been made to enable free flow of sunlight. Crucifix, with statues of Mary and St. John on either side, has been installed. The new glass mosaic behind the crucifix has been designed in such a way that it symbolises the grace of god. Similarly, on both sides of the Blessed Sacrament, angels in kneeling form have been carved on glass mosaic. A new 7-storied bell tower has been built at a cost of Rs. 10 lakhs. The 75-feet tall structure has been fitted with a new Panchaloka bell (weighing 350 kg, costing Rs. 7 lakhs) imported from Poland. Another added feature is a towering the 46-feet tall flag mast plated with copper. History St. Teresas Church, Nungambakkam, established in 1912, is located in the heart of city. This Parish was under the control of the Mill Hill Fathers until 1929. Later, it came under the control of the Diocese of Madras. The people at this parish are engaged in uplifting the poor through education. Three schools are attached to it and they offer integral information and leadership training to more than 3,000 students who mostly come from the nearby slums. In view of the centenary year, the church is also organising religious tours to the Holy Land and to Goa. Hundred hours of Eucharistic adoration was conducted as a preparation for the blessing of the restored church.  The 100-year-old historical structure has been spruced up completely.  OPEN",

In his New Year's Eve message to the people of the State on Friday, Mr. Reddy reiterated his government's commitment to help the farmers in distress. Natural calamities Five successive natural calamities this year alone had caused untold misery to the farmers and the government was determined to do everything to bring back smile on their faces. Special package Stating that his government had already approached the Centre for a special package to provide assistance to the farmers, the Chief Minister said a series of steps like enhancing the input subsidy and waiving the interest of crop loans had been taken to help them. Mr. Reddy said Andhra Pradesh had achieved development that no other State could come near it. The faith reposed by the people in the 2009 election would be repaid with sincerity and commitment. Social security The Congress government has stood out by its concern for social security for the people by implementing several path-breaking programmes, he added. Listing out his government's priorities, the Chief Minister said all the ongoing welfare schemes would be completed within a fixed time-frame, the Indiramma housing scheme continued and social security pensions were being given to the needy people on time.

But, the articulate chess prodigy was not short of interest while giving valuable tips to select players at the Cyber Chess Academy in the city on Thursday. Within hours on arrival, Nebolsina was engaged in simultaneous chess with whom she strongly believes to be future champions, given the talent in them. Unlike many of her Russian counterparts, she is fluent in English. Well, I was in China for two years to pursue my University studies before going back home. I am a student of International Relations in Novosibirsk State Technical University in my hometown, she said. Praise for Humpy Interestingly, Nebolsina is happy to be in the State from where World No.2 Koneru Humpy hails. I rate her as the strongest woman player, and [she] will win the world championship very soon. She is an exceptional player with great skills in positional and strategic play, she said. What made this Russian champion to come to the city? Well, two years ago, during a tournament in Portugal, IM Lanka Ravi mooted this idea, says the world junior champion. Coaching is not new to me, having watched my mother run the Academy for quite some time now, says Nebolsina, who will fly back to Delhi for an international tournament next month. Taken by surprise' Every player should remember that each piece on the chess board has its own value and every move should only enhance that for better results, is Nebolsina's philosophy. I was taken by surprise by some of the moves these young kids came up against me. They just need to put in hard work and more exposure to be much better players, she said. Essentially, they should dream big, work hard to achieve the goals, signed off the Russian before another round of simultaneous chess. Lanka Ravi, the first International Master from Andhra Pradesh who runs the Academy, hopes that this wonderful camp by Nebolsina will only see him produce many more champions.  OPEN",

Pointing out that about 45 to 50 million devotees descended on Sabarimala every year, he said that they unwittingly discarded plastic containers, plates, cups etc which posed a major threat to the fauna and flora. Stating that the Sabarimala Devasvom Board has drawn up a plan of action to protect the environment of the hill, he said that it cannot be done without the cooperation of the devotees. Exhorting them not to carry with them items including cosmetics made of chemicals, he said that they should ensure that puja accessories are not adulterated. Adverting to the significance of the Pamba River, he said that its pollution should be prevented. Intoxicants in any form should be avoided.

According to official sources, the Union Government has sanctioned Rs. 1 crore to the State Archaeology Department to conduct research on the Malliabad fort and the monuments, and also conserve and preserve them. The strong fort surrounding Malliabad village occupies a place of significance in the history of Raichur. The remnants of a Vishnu temple and a pair of life sized elephants exquisitely carved in white granite located within the fortress of Malliabad, which were said to be built during the 13th Century by the Kakatiya Queen of Warrangal, are important historical monuments which throw light on the rule of the Vijayanagar Empire. It is said that Vijayanagar Emperor Krishnadevaraya stayed with his army in this fort during the historic battle of Raichur in 1520 A.D. against the Adil Shahi Sultan of Bijapur. Two years ago, the State Government had released Rs. 40 lakh to the Department of Archaeology here to take up the restoration of a historical Vishnu temple located near the stone elephants and provide protect the historical monuments in its surroundings. The department spent the funds for excavation work but did not do anything to protect and preserve the monuments. In the last week of November, Regional Commissioner of Gulbarga Rajneesh Goel visited Malliabad along with the officials of the Archaeological Department. After inspecting the site where excavation was done, he directed the officials of the State Archaeological Department to protect the monuments that were found after excavation. He said that he would ensure that more Central funds were sanctioned for the purpose. Chickamaregowda, Deputy Director, Archaeological Museum, Hampi (Bellary), visited the historical sites at Malliabad on Thursday to study the present situation on the steps taken to protect the fort and monuments. According the Deputy Director, the Department of Archaeology has decided to conduct an extensive research on the fort and the monuments at Malliabad village. The department will constitute a team of historians from Kannada University Hampi to go ahead with the research work on the history of Malliabad.

Nambella Sanketigella Onde (We all Sanketis are one) was the voice of oneness, which surrounded the venue of the conference in the traditional Sanketi language under the banner Vasudaiva Kutumbakam. With the intention to promote the Sanketi language, culture, literature, music, spirituality and religious rituals to the next generations and spread them all over the world, this significant three-day conference was inaugurated by businessman and social worker B.N.V. Subramanya. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Subramanya said that like other communities the Sanketi community also had got caught in the whirlpool of the western culture. It was a dangerous development and if such conditions prevailed then the richness of the Sanketi culture would not be digestive for the coming generations, he said. He said this conference was an important platform in order to unite the community under one umbrella. This conference should become a pathfinder in the future days, he added. Mr. Subramanya said that no practices of the Sanketis were meaningless. Every thing had its own significance and it should not be taken in a lighter way, he said. He said the achievers of the community were the role models for the young generation. The youths should follow their footsteps to achieve better goals in their lives, he added. Each and every person had one or the other learning qualities but one need a good mindset to grasp them, he said. Presiding over the inaugural session, noted scholar Dr. Mattoor Krishnamurthy said that though the Sanketi language had no script, it had a vast cultural heritage. There was a need to strengthen out roots without inclining towards modern culture. He said the Sanketis should prove that they stand united emotionally though they had crossed the geographical boundaries. There was also the need to safeguard the Sanketi language and culture, he said. Dr. Pranatharti Haran of the Community Study Centre of Mysore, Dr. Vijaya Haran of Mysore, Dr. M.S. Nataraj and Ms Geeta Nataraj, literary persons from USA and President of the Sanketi Conference Sri Markandeya Avadhani were present.

Mr. Gowda began his address recalling the mistake committed by his son and the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who joined hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party to come to power. Mr. Gowda said he was pained by the fact that his son chose to become the Chief Minister through indirect means, and at the cost of his party. However, much to his relief, Mr. Kumaraswamy was now repenting his mistake. Mr. Gowda recalled the criticism he faced when his son became the Chief Minister. Many people alleged that I was behind his elevation. I was nowhere involved and the party leaders conspired to keep me away from the developments. I was so much hurt that I didnt even go to the swearing in ceremony. I have never compromised with principles, he said. Mr. Gowda said any political party that neglected the problems of farmers would not survive in the State. Referring to the Global Investors Meet conducted by the government, he questioned the rationale behind acquiring over 1.8 lakh acres of fertile farmland on the pretext of industrial development. Industries such as Brahmani steels had signed memorandum of understanding with the government. The government should come out with details on how many industries had been setup and how they had helped the people of the State, he said.  OPEN",

Forest fires and the reduced availability of fodder and drinking water may force wild animals out of their territories. They may venture into human habitations in search of water and food, according to wildlife authorities. E.A. Jayson, head of the Wildlife Division of the Kerala Forest Research Institute, Thrissur, said that conflicts in each area would be influenced by a host of local factors such as availability of food and water and proximity to forest area. A recent meeting of the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority had cautioned the State Forest Department against the possibility of human-animal conflicts increasing significantly during drought months. The Forest Department was asked to ensure sufficient water for animals in sanctuaries, said a member of the authority. Animals may come in search of drinking water into human habitations from forest areas where there are no reservoirs. Wayanad was one such district, said Dr. Jayson. Monitoring needed Conflicts are unlikely in Parambikulam, Vazhachal, Idukki, and Peppara areas where there are reservoirs. Herds of elephants would move to the reservoirs during the dry spell. However, the Forest Department needed to monitor the vulnerable areas and take adequate measures to address the issue. Priority should be given to the drinking water needs of animals, he said. R. Sugathan, a wildlife expert, said that crop raids by elephants and wild boar might increase in the Thattekad area of Malayattur Forest division in Ernakulam district. Animals raid farmlands in search of food when grasslands and shrubs dry up. Water is available here in the lake near the sanctuary, Mr. Sugathan said. Animals invade the farmlands where banana, pineapple, and tubers are cultivated. It is estimated that there are around 40 elephants in the sanctuary area. Besides elephants, sambars too come out searching for food, said Mr. Sugathan, who is associated with the sanctuary. V. Gopinath, Chief Wildlife Warden, Kerala, said that check-dams were being constructed in the interiors of forest to provide drinking water to animals. They may reach the water sources when forest dries up. Though one can generally state that there is the possibility of human-animal conflicts shooting up during summer months, there is nothing alarming in Kerala forests, he said.

The December season of Chennai has all the features that qualify it to become a season of World Music and Dance Festival. I suggest that you may please sit together and plan for a December Global Art Festival at Chennai. You can count on me for my help and support, she said, inaugurating the 86{+t}{+h}Annual Conference and Concerts of the Music Academy here. Ms. Jayalalithaa presented the Sangita Kalanidhi M.S. Subbulakshmi award, instituted by The Hindu , to vocalist and Sangita Kalanidhi-designate Trichur V. Ramachandran, who was elected president of the Annual Conference and Concerts of the Music Academy. Describing Carnatic music as one of the best offerings of our culture and the essence of all musical experience, the Chief Minister said south Indias foremost legacy was its rich musical tradition and Carnatic music had seen the pinnacle of glory of 2,000 years of evolution. Today, it has achieved such perfection with intricate nuances of sruti, raga, bhava and sahitya that it may have very few parallels in the world of music, she said, amidst enthusiastic response from the audience. Ms. Jayalalithaa explained the antiquity and unique features of Tamil music with references found in Tholkappiam , the ancient treatise on grammar, and Tamil classic Silappathikaram . It contains mines of information on music, dance and various musical instruments, she said and went on to explain the contribution by Alwars and Nayanmars towards enriching music. Alwars and Nayanmars sought infinite bliss through devotional love of a sublime kind and gave musical expression through their Prabhandams and Thiruppadhigams. Commending the Music Academy for nurturing and popularising Carnatic music, Ms. Jayalalithaa said the future belonged to younger musicians. They are our cultural ambassadors, she said and advised them to do rigorous practice to sharpen their skills. Second homecoming Music Academy president N. Murali said it was a second homecoming for the Chief Minister, who first inaugurated the festival in 1991. Though she was invited in 2005, she had to cancel her participation due to unprecedented rain in Chennai as it required her personal monitoring of the situation. He said Trichur Ramachandran was selected for the Sangita Kalanidhi award exactly 50 years after he gave his first concert in the Academy. Mr. Murali said the Sadas on January 1, 2013 would be presided over by Justice V. Ramasubramanian of the Madras High Court. The Sangita Kalanidhi award would be presented that day. Stressing the aspect of listening in music, Ramachandran said music students should listen to a number of concerts of senior and good artistes to create new and great styles with innovation, without deviating from the boundaries of tradition. Sangita Kalanidhis R. Vedavalli and Trichy Sankaran, and Academy secretaries N. Ramji and K.V. Krishna Prasad participated.   OPEN",

        "content": " India is among the fastest growing economies in the area of renewable energy. Global players have either set up shop or are poised to enter the renewable energy area, spurred by the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission in the 11th Plan. The Government is getting ready to launch the second phase of this mission in the Twelfth Plan. According to Ernst & Young study, Indias investment in renewable energy totalled $10.4 billion in 2011, growing 54 per cent over 2010  the second fastest among G-20 countries. The wind energy sector attracted $4.6 billion in 2011, adding 2.8 GW of capacity. Wind attracted 67 per cent of venture capital or private equity funding and 98 per cent of all new build asset finance, raised in year-to-date in India, across all forms of renewables. It is estimated that with Generation Based Incentive Scheme and Renewable Energy Certificates being the next wave of reforms, it is likely to transform wind energy in India. However, E&Y said that repeal of the Accelerated Depreciation tax break will have an adverse impact on investment. The study states that power evacuation infrastructure has not kept pace with the development of wind. Tamil Nadu provides an example of a state where many plants are unable to evacuate the energy because of lack of infrastructure. With over 16 GW installed capacity, wind accounts for nearly 66 per cent of the renewable energy installed in India. The States of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat are leaders; the total potential is around 46 to 70 GW. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has envisaged that wind will constitute 70 per cent of overall renewable energy capacity translating to 2-3 GW of new capacity per year till 2020. Solar is currently high on absolute costs compared to other conventional sources of power such as coal. The objective of the Solar Mission is to create conditions, through rapid scale-up of capacity and technological innovation to drive down costs towards grid parity. The Mission anticipates achieving grid parity by 2022 and parity with coal-based thermal power by 2030, but recognises that this cost trajectory will depend upon the scale of global deployment and technology development and transfer. The cost projections vary  from 22 per cent for every doubling of capacity to a reduction of only 60 per cent with global deployment increasing 16 times the current level. India is endowed with vast solar energy potential. About 5,000 trillion kWh per year energy is incident over Indias land area with most parts receiving 4-7 kWh per sq m per day. Hence both technology routes for conversion of solar radiation into heat and electricity, namely, solar thermal and solar photovoltaics, can effectively be harnessed providing huge scalability for solar in India. Theoretically, a small fraction of the total incident solar energy, captured effectively, can meet the countrys power requirements. The objective of the National Solar Mission is to establish India as a global leader in solar energy, by creating the policy conditions for its diffusion across the country. The Mission adopts a 3-phase approach, spanning the 11th Plan and first year of the 12th Plan (up to 2012-13) as Phase 1, the remaining 4 years of the 12th Plan (2013-17) as Phase 2 and the 13th Plan (2017-22) as Phase 3. At the end of each plan, and mid-term during the 12th and 13th Plans, there will be an evaluation of progress, review of capacity and targets for subsequent phases, based on emerging cost and technology trends, both domestic and global. The policy aims at deploying 20,000 MW of solar power by 2022. To ramp up capacity of grid-connected solar power generation to 1,000 MW within three years  by 2013; an additional 3000 MW by 2017 through the mandatory use of the renewable purchase obligation by utilities backed with a preferential tariff. This capacity can be more than doubled  reaching 10,000MW installed power by 2017 or more, based on the enhanced and enabled international finance and technology transfer.

Mr. Vishwanath and MCCI members, led by their president Sudhakar Shetty, visited the airport here on Saturday and spoke to airport officials following the resumption of commercial flight operations from Mysore from January 14. Convener of the Association of Concerned and Informed Citizens of Mysore (ACICM) M. Lakshman and Congress leader H.A. Venkatesh were present. Officer-in-charge of Mysore airport Manjunath told presspersons that SpiceJet had announced flight timings and schedules up to March 2013. The plane will leave Bangalore at 12.20 p.m. and arrive at Mysore at 1.10 pm. It will depart from Mysore at 1.30 p.m. to reach Bangalore at 2.20 p.m. Outbound passengers from Mysore will get connecting flights to Mumbai, New Delhi and Chennai at Bangalore airport. Mr. Shetty said that morning and evening flights from Mysore would be convenient for industry representatives. Mr. Vishwanath replied that he would speak to the respective Civil Aviation Ministry officials. Later, addressing presspersons, Mr. Vishwanath expressed happiness over the resumption of commercial operations and said that air connectivity would benefit the city and help develop industry and tourism in the region. Chartered flights have been flying to and from Mysore even though there were no commercial operations from the airport for over a year. The airport handled 150 chartered flights in 2010 and 155 in 2011. This indicates the citys potential, Mr. Vishwanath said. In a memorandum, Mr. Vishwanath urged Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar to call a meeting of all airline operators. He also urged Mr. Shettar to take steps to expand the airport to handle bigger aircraft. The existing runway could be expanded from 1,740 m to 2,600 m, allowing bigger plans to operate and facilitating direct flights to and from Mysore, he said. Though the Centre had set aside Rs. 140 crore for the airports expansion, the State government had yet to release land and other facilities. The airport needs to be upgraded urgently, he said. Mr. Manjunath said 175 acres out of 300 had been acquired for the airports expansion.

There are 109 sites ready for allotment. MUDA is releasing these sites for public purposes after a gap of seven years, as the last such allotment (of CA sites) was conducted in 2005. In addition, 20 CA sites have been reserved for boards or corporations established by either the State or Union governments. MUDA chairman P. Nagendra told presspersons here on Saturday that allotment would be based on MUDA guidelines. Only institutions, societies or associations registered under the Karnataka Society Registration Act 1960 or a cooperative society registered under the Cooperative Societies Act are eligible to apply. The last date for submission of applications is February 8. The lease period will be 30 years and the amount has been fixed at Rs. 1,087 per sq m, Mr. Nagendra said. Organisations representing Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, those engaged in the rehabilitation of the mentally challenged and disabled, and Kannada medium schools will be given 50 per cent concession. However, MUDA officials have clarified that they cannot release sites for residential purposes. Of 129 sites, 15 per cent has been reserved for institutions working for the welfare of SC groups and 3 per cent for those working for ST communities. Officials have clarified that no changes in land-use would be permitted, and beneficiaries should adhere to the purpose for which the site was allotted in the first place. MUDA Commissioner C.G. Betsurmath pointed out that there have been instances in which the CA allotment was rescinded due to violations, the most common being the failure to utilise the land for which it was allotted. In recent months, MUDA launched a drive to ascertain whether CA sites are being used for the same purpose for which they were released. There have been 16 cancellations so far, of which nine were due to non-payment of equated monthly instalments and seven for not using the land for the purpose for which it was allotted.

After working on ecology and the behaviour of elephants in Karnataka between 198090, Mr. Desai focussed on mitigating the human-elephant conflict and assisting the State Forest Department. As per the 2010 census of elephant population, there are about 5,500 to 6,000 elephants in the forests of Karnataka, which amounts to 25 per cent of Indias total estimated elephant population. Due to the fragmentation of their habitats, changes in land-use patterns and the blockage of elephant corridors, a severe man-elephant conflict has been reported in the Mysore region, comprising the districts of Mysore, Kodagu, Hassan, and Chamarajanagar, and in Ramnagaram and Bangalore Rural districts, the release said. Apart from crop and property damage, there were several human deaths reported each year. As per the available figures from the office of the Chief Conservator of Forests, Project Elephant, Mysore, 34 persons were killed during 201011. The number came down to 14 during 201112.

In a seminar on Voice care for students and teachers, conducted by Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre in coordination with Medical Advance Research Foundation, close to 150 teachers got a respite from talking. Dr. M. Kumaresan, who engaged the teachers at the day-long seminar, began with the very basics  breathing techniques. I have noticed that after 10 years of teaching, close to 20 per cent of teachers develop voice-related problems, he said. Ms. Sarala who has been teaching for close to 15 years recalls how she did not take voice-associated risks seriously, early on. Of late, I have been facing a lot of difficulty with my voice and am undergoing treatment. The seminar was very hands-on as we were taught how to reach out to a larger number of students without raising our voice, she said. Amid deafening silence and raucous laughter, teachers were introduced to the basic principles of voice care and how to include it in daily routine, necessary lifestyle changes for a healthy voice, speech therapy, basics of virtual reality therapy and chiefly, breathing techniques. A healthy respiratory system is key to a healthy voice. Ideally, the abdomen must come out when you inhale, and go in when you exhale, Dr. Kumaresan said. The most common problem in teachers, he said, is the formation of a nodule or a growth in the vocal chords. It feels like something sticking in the throat, but in reality, there would be nothing. This occurs mainly due to misuse and overuse of vocal chords. If detected when still a soft nodule, specific breathing exercises can cure it, he said. The symptoms of this problem would manifest as normal speech in the morning, but a hoarse voice by evening. Professionals who employ their voice, such as singers, teachers, actors and politicians, must produce sound from the abdomen rather than the throat, Dr. Kumaresan said. This, combined with breathing exercises taught during the seminar, will help her overcome the risks faced, another teacher, V.V. Neeraja said. I handle classes I to VIII and have no break from talking all day. The breathing exercises we learnt were quick and can be done in between classroom sessions, she said. The seminar was inaugurated by Chennai mayor Saidai S. Duraisamy, and a book titled Meimai Maruthuvam by Dr. Kumaresan was also released on the occasion.   OPEN",

Delivering a talk on Brand India at Aspinwall House, a biennale venue, the former tourism secretary of Kerala recalled how certain programmes designed under his guidance were successful in boosting Keralas and Indias image as a cultural destination. Among them were campaigns such as Gods Own Country and Incredible India, besides those meant to give training to guides as well as taxi drivers, and creating awareness among people about preserving heritage sites and tourist resorts, he was quoted in a biennale press release. Mr. Kant said records showed an average of 30 people in India moving every minute from villages to urban areas in search of livelihood. The tourism segment is what aids their job prospects. There are ways to boost it. We have to use them well, he said. We brand our land not as an advertisement, but as an experience. On an awareness campaign by the Union tourism department, he said the advertisements had been conceptualised based on the need for inculcating a habit among children to conserve legacies and to maintain the surroundings clean. Involving local communities in such moves could bring in better results, he added. Later, princess Hoor al-Qasimi, Sharjah Art Foundation president, along with Yuko Hasegawa, curator of the upcoming biennale in the West Asian Emirate, explained its aesthetic and organisational aspects. Ghanaian artist Bernard Akoi-Jackson will deliver a talk at the same venue on Sunday. Union Minister of State for Human Resource Development Shashi Tharoor is slated to speak on Globalisation and Human Imagination on Monday at 12 noon.  OPEN",

(The council had been seeking compensation for the land abandoned by the tribespeople). The flaws in implementing the voluntary relocation project of the government left the tribespeople with no choice but to reoccupy the land, council convener S. Shobhankumar said. Under the project, 40 families had been relocated on June 24. Only 24 of the families got the promised compensation of Rs.10 lakh each, he said. When the project was announced on April 9, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy had assured the tribespeople that they would get compensation as per the guidelines of the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitat Scheme in three months. But the Chief Minister could not keep his word, Mr. Shobhankumar said. The guidelines said male children over 18 years of age; unmarried female children above the age of 18; physically and mentally challenged persons irrespective of their age and sex; minor orphans; and widows or women divorcees would be treated as separate families. A survey conducted by the Kerala Forest Research Institute, Peechi, a few years ago had identified 96 eligible families in the hamlet. But many families were excluded from the final list prepared by the Forest Department, Krishnan Kottamkara, 57, a tribal farmer of the hamlet said. Krishanan Kottamkara was born and brought up in the hamlet and he had 520 acres of leased land there. The authorities failed to include him on the final list as he was hospitalised following cardiac arrest. Many others who were not present at the hamlet during an inspection by the authorities had also been excluded, Mr. Shobhankumar said. There were six eligible families in his house according to the KFRI list, he added. When the forest officials prepared the final list, I was undergoing eye surgery in a Coimbatore hospital, Elias, another resident of the hamlet, said. He was later included on the list after he could convince the officials about the issue but, was yet to get any compensation, he added. They had left the hamlet in June expecting that they would get the compensation soon, Mariyil Kuriakose, who had been living outside the forest since, said. Hence, we decided to live in our land till we get compensation, he added. As many as 12 tribesmen had got possession certificates for their land under the Forest Rights Act in 2010.  OPEN",

Rinu Srinivasan, whowas arrested in Mumbai last month for sharing and liking a Facebook postwill star in the video. The song is called Facebook Mania and was planned almost three months ago. It has nothing to do with the controversy, says Rinu. The song was recorded and shot at a studio in Thirumangalam. Last month, Rinu and a friend, Shaheen Dhada, were arrested for a Facebook post put up by the latter criticising the shutdown in Mumbai following Bal Thackerays death. The song describes how Facebook has changed lives and made us connect with people in different ways, says Sumith Menon, an IT professional, who has composed the song and sung it, along with Rinu. The song is part of a music album titled One Roof and will be released in four languages  Hindi, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam. It is being produced by a group of IT professionals, led by Saroj Karoidan. Magesh Balakrishnan, the lyricist says, The cameramen, videographers and actors in the video as well as many of the crew members are from different places and we got in touch only through online communities. We held extensive meetings online to decide everything, in order to minimise travel, he adds. The group got in touch with Rinu after a friend told them about her online recordings. For the 20-year-old, the last few weeks have been traumatic, and she is now hoping for some peace and quiet. I seem to be travelling constantly. TV shows in Delhi and other cities, interviews, now this recording, says Rinu, who will be leaving soon for Ahmedabad. Shaheen and I have been invited to talk to the students of IIM-Ahmedabad. I am quite nervous. It is not as easy as music recording, she said. Rinus parents are also in Chennai for now. Our flat in Palghar, Mumbai, has police protection all the time. There is no threat now, but it is awkward for all our neighbours. They keep asking us when the police will leave but even the policemen dont seem to know, said R. Srinivasan, Rinus father. Rinus family hails from Kumarakom in Kerala but has lived in Mumbai for the past twenty years. While the family will leave for Kerala soon, Rinu will pursue a two-year course in sound engineering at Muzik Lounge School of Audio Technology in Vadapalani. I want to go back to Mumbai after my course. It is home after all, she says.  OPEN",

Sudalaimuthu, Vice-Chancellor, Alagappa University, has said. Inaugurating a two-day, University Grants Commission-sponsored conference on New vistas: Exploring issues of women in Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, organised by the PG Department of Economics and Research Centre, Sethupathi Government Arts College, in collaboration with School of Economics, Madurai Kamaraj University, here on Friday, he said, The scheme aims at enhancing the livelihood security of the rural people, especially women, but its success hugely relied on officials who implement the scheme. Rules, regulations and objectives had clearly been laid out in the scheme, but it was still beset with controversies pertaining to under-payment and other manipulations, he said, calling for self-imposed regulations among officials. They should implement the scheme in right spirit to help the rural population to improve their standard of living, he said. Apart from providing employment to the rural people, the scheme had paved way for visible growth in rural areas, he said, adding that the scheme would be a success and go a long way in empowering the women, only if the officials discharged their duties honestly. A. Ranga Reddy, Emeritus Professor of Economics, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati, said that there was lot of women development in the Asian countries and remarkable changes were taking place in the backward areas where women started playing key roles in developmental activities. Stating that women perform multiple tasks he said that the MGNREGA had definitely provided a launch pad for women to improve their standard of living through additional income. Women education would lead to their empowerment and in future, women development would be Indias development, he said. Speaking on the conference theme, V. Hariharan, Head, School of Economics, Madurai Kamaraj University, said that the had helped in generating income and increase the purchasing power of rural people. Women workers were discriminated in the unorganised sector, but the scheme helped in solving the issue. The scheme also provided social security to women, he said. M. Mohammed Ibrahim, Principal, Sethupathi Government Arts College, said that experts who had come from different parts of the country would explore and deliberate on problems faced by women in the scheme and come out with solutionsT.

Addressing captains of industry at the 85{+t}{+h}annual general meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the Prime Minister made it known that his eyes were now set on reforms in GAAR (General Anti Avoidance Rules), IT, Railways and pharma sectors, land acquisition, taxation, disinvestment and subsidies. Dr. Singh made clear his intentions of completing the exercise on GAAR and taxation of the IT sector, bringing greater clarity in the FDI policy in the pharma sector, setting up the Rail Tariff Authority for rationally fixing passenger fares and freight charges, putting in place the Direct Tax Code (DTC) and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bills. Clarity would be given to the FDI policy in the pharma sector, he said, holding out the assurance that the industry concerns had been addressed in the Land Acquisition Bill, which the Cabinet recently approved. The government would be addressing issues of under-pricing of energy, particularly electricity, and petroleum products, but the Prime Minister promised to protect the poor and the vulnerable effectively. While the disinvestment process would be speeded up to revive the equity markets, the governments decision to set up the Cabinet Committee on Investment was expected to clear major projects in a time-bound manner. Committing to root out pessimism, Dr. Singh promised to alter policy environment not only to accelerate economic growth but also ensure the growth process was socially and regionally more inclusive. Referring to the measures initiated recently, the Prime Minister maintained that these were taken at reviving investor sentiments, controlling the fiscal and current account deficits and improving infrastructure and savings rates commensurate with the requirement of an annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 8 to 9 per cent. He stated that some of these decisions had been politically difficult. The naysayers and the cynics have tried to halt us in our tracks. But we had the courage of our conviction and the interests of our people at heart. The Prime Minister explained the decisions on FDI in retail, civil aviation, power trading exchanges and broadcasting, which were also driven by considerations of slowing global trade and were based on what he termed as sound economic logic. Ignorance He lashed out at those who opposed these moves. Im afraid those who oppose these moves are either ignorant of global realities or are constrained by outdated ideologies. For example, when I hear the debate on FDI in retail, what I hear are arguments against large-scale organised retail and not against FDI in retail. Not sparing industry either, Dr. Singh said time was ripe to establish a new social compact between business, government and society and called upon them to own up responsibility in supporting government action and providing employment for the under-privileged sections and physically challenged people and women.

        "content": " Immediately after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday lashed out at the critics of FDI in retail, saying their opposition was constrained by outdated ideologies, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee hit back, claiming that she belonged to the grassroots and was outdated. Her retort came after the Prime Minister made the remarks in his speech at the 85{+t}{+h}annual general meeting of the Federations of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry here. When journalists sought her reaction after the meeting, the West Bengal Chief Minister said she was part of the grassroots. The masses were generally outdated. So was she. Ms. Banerjee withdrew her partys support to the UPA after the Manmohan Singh government decided to allow foreign players in the multi-brand retail sector. The Trinamool Congress moved a no-confidence motion against the government in the Lok Sabha and voted for a motion, moved later, for withdrawal of the policy. Both fell through. Addressing the FICCI meeting, Ms. Banerjee made an impassioned appeal to India Inc. to invest in West Bengal, promising to go the extra mile to resolve their problems and create infrastructure. Raising the contentious issue of land acquisition, she said her government would give permission for purchase of land for opening industrial units. She promised to formulate a land acquisition policy after the Centre came up with its legislation, but vowed not to touch farmland. To highlight her intent, she said that a couple of days ago, her government cleared 14 petitions relating to land for industrial purposes. Urging industrialists to invest in tourism, deep-sea port, and tea, Ms. Banerjee assured them that there would be no disturbance in the State, which boasted power surplus and cheap labour. The Chief Minister criticised the Centre for not bailing the State out of its financial problems stemming from its high debt. Is it not the duty of the Centre to take care of [the States finances] when my hands are tied and [I] cannot take loan, and the RBI simply draws Rs. 26,000 crore from our account annually? We are not begging. That is out right. How will we give food to the people? We are not against other States. They too deserve their share, she told reporters later.   OPEN",

        "content": " United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi on Saturday launched the Delhi governments ambitious food security programme, Dilli Annshree Yojana, a direct benefit transfer system and described it as a first-of-its-kind food security scheme integrated with the UID Aadhar in the country. Ms. Gandhi asserted that the scheme, under which a monthly cash subsidy of Rs. 600 will be directly transferred to the bank account of the seniormost female member of 2 lakh poor families, will help eradicate hunger from the country. The scheme, she said, was a testimony to the State governments efforts in providing a helping hand to vulnerable families, and an effort to empower women. The scheme was not an alternative to the public distribution system, but was an extension of existing food security efforts being undertaken under the PDS, she said. It would provide an option to beneficiaries to purchase food items and essentials whenever required. Ms. Gandhi said the city government had decided to provide assistance to 25 lakh people under the first phase. Handing out bank passbooks and Annshree enrolment certificates to 12 women beneficiaries who reside in slums and resettlement colonies in Delhi, Ms. Gandhi witnessed the process of transferring the assistance amount to their accounts, and withdrawal by them with the help of a micro ATM, assisted by bank correspondents. Supporting the direct transfer scheme, Ms. Gandhi said it would benefit a large number of unreached, vulnerable and poor households. Hailing the scheme as the countrys first totally Aadhar-based cash transfer programme, Ms. Gandhi said the Central governments Direct Benefit Transfer system would be implemented in 51 districts from January 1, 2013, facilitating cash entitlement in a total of 32 schemes. The purpose of this scheme, she said, was to make sure that the governments money being disbursed in pension, scholarship, MNREGA wage payment and social benefit schemes reached the beneficiaries directly, without any delay. She clarified that these did not include food safety and subsidy schemes. The Union government, she pointed out, would come up with a Food Security Bill to overcome hunger in the country. Referring to the help handed out to the poor identified on the basis of the BPL system, Ms. Gandhi said there were many problems related to the BPL list, as a number of needy and poor families were not included in these lists. The direct transfer system would provide food security to the people who had been left out, she said.  OPEN",

However, the documentary of 27-minute duration, made in Kashmiri and English, has been funded by subsidiaries of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB), and has also been certified as legitimate by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). A gathering of more than 200 men and women  mostly students, teachers, filmmakers and social activists  raised slogans outside the KUs Convocation Hall in favour of Azadi and the hardliner separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani. They alleged that the KU authorities initially allowed screening of the film and collected the stipulated fee from the director, but finally disallowed the event under police pressure. They are more loyal than the king, co-researcher and director of the film titled Ocean of Tears , Bilal Jan, complained to The Hindu . We had completed all the procedural formalities. They previewed and cleared the documentary, and thereafter made us deposit a fee of Rs. 20,000. We got sponsors and put up paid advertisements in local newspapers. A gathering of more than 200 eminent persons turned up to attend the screening. But, at the eleventh hour, we were told that the screening couldnt be allowed, as according to them, someone had submitted a complaint, claiming that the director had plagiarised his footage, Mr. Jan explained. According to Mr. Jan, Superintendent of Police, Hazratbal zone, Abdul Qayoom remained closeted with the KU Registrar, Professor Zaffar Ahmad Rishi, for a long time, and the police prevented the invitees from entering the auditorium. He confirmed that the film was selectively on the plight of women who had been raped and tortured by the Army, their sons who had been killed and husbands subjected to enforced disappearance. However, he insisted, there was nothing wrong or unlawful in making and screening such a documentary as, according to him, it had been approved and funded by MIBs Films Division and a key subsidiary, the Public Service Broadcasting Trust (PSBT). According to Mr. Jans statement and documents, the film had been cleared by PSBTs eminent panel of filmmakers and critics. They included FTII Punes Professor (Film) Suresh Chhabria, the former director-general of Doordarshan, Bhaskar Ghosh, and prominent critic K. Vikram. It credits the high-profile filmmaker, Rajiv Mehrotra, as the producer of the film. Anchor of DDs longest-run talk show In Conversation and a graduate in Master of Fine Arts in Film Direction from the University of Columbia in 1981, Mr. Mehrotra played a key role in producing the film and getting it cleared from the censor authorities, Mr. Jan said. From 2000, he has been Managing Trustee, Executive Producer and Commissioning Editor of The Public Service Broadcasting Trust (PSBT), which has produced more than 400 documentary films, winning some 100 awards from 250 international film festival screenings. His films have won numerous international awards and 18 national awards from the President of India, Mr. Mehrotras profile on Wikipedia says. Yes, its true that almost all the local business tycoons and prominent NGOs refused to sponsor the screening event. They invariably argued that the film ran against the government agencies and its CBFC certificate and PSBT sponsorship wasnt enough, Mr. Jan revealed. He informed that the main part of the film was on the infamous Kunan-Poshpora (Kupwara) alleged mass rape of February 1991, and the rape-cum-murder of two young women in Shopian in 2009. A 7-minute video, which has been running on YouTube since October this year, has recorded 145,000 views until Saturday. It carries emotional statements of the victims of state terror, all invariably holding Army and paramilitary forces guilty of gang rape, murder, custodial killing and torture. It does not contain the reaction of the Army, the BSF, the CRPF or any government agency to the explicitly-used statements. Mr. Jan said the CBFC members were divided regarding clearing the film, but chairperson Leela Samson was assertive in convincing the people who were against its clearance. KUs Registrar, Professor Zaffar Ahmad Rishi, insisted that the screening was stopped only after a local activist of a Gujarat-based NGO complained that his work had been plagiarised by the producers and researchers of the documentary. We had given the permission [for screening], but once we received the complaint we withdrew it, Professor Rishi told The Hindu . Copyright and plagiarism is a big issue in universities these days. Nobody wants to land in trouble.  OPEN",

Inaugurating the solar power generation unit at Shanmuganathan Engineering College, Arasampatti near Thirumayam on Wednesday, Dr. Jayachandran said that field of solar field offered ample opportunities for research and employment in India and abroad. It is ideal for engineering colleges to produce and use solar power. He commended the Shanmuganathan Engineering College for being a forerunner in solar power production in this region, at a time when the State government has just announced its solar policy. There is scarcity of power not only in Tamil Nadu but also in other States. All States are taking necessary steps to overcome power scarcity but it is necessary to produce power without affecting environment. Solar power is eco-friendly and it can be produced in large quantities. In Tamil Nadu, we get sunlight for 300 days in a year, he said, and added that southern parts of Tamil Nadu are suitable for producing solar power and based on this fact the State government has formulated its solar policy. In daylight large amount of solar power can be produced and saved as there is no necessity for spill over and transmission. If we pay attention to this renewable energy source, Tamil Nadu could be a State with surplus power. The educated should create public awareness of importance of solar power, he said. Dr. Jayachandran said in 1990s the CECRI erected street lamps in 200 villages in Ramanathapuram and Sivagangai districts from the fund of Rs. 25 lakh sanctioned by the State government. When a review was made after three years it was observed that villagers maintained the street lamps very well. He advised the students to take up projects and research on solar power. The Shanmuganathan College has established a solar power unit with 10kw capacity. P. Manikandan, correspondent of the college, presided. M. Viswanathan, secretary, and RM. Muthiah, principal, offered felicitations.  OPEN",

Driving home the importance of expanding the scope of mutts, mandirs and viharas beyond the purpose of worship to serve as learning centres for believers as well as interested non-believers, the Dalai Lama said: This should not be done with the intention of preaching. All, even those who do not believe in the faith should be able to partake of the knowledge. We have to remain within our traditional religious beliefs. We should not convert. A perfect example of peace and harmony, given the co-existence of several religions, he called India, Arya bhumi Bharat.

The decomposed bodies of the two fishermen  V. Kamalappan (40) and I. Somasundaram (45)  were washed ashore at Manthoppu in Thangachimadam and under the Pamban Road Bridge, respectively, police said. The fishermen, hailing from Nagapattinam district, had gone for fishing in a Fibreglass Reinforced Plastic boat on December 27 and went missing since then. Their abandoned boat with fishing net on the high seas was brought to the shore the next day by local fishermen. They launched a search operation but they could not trace them. Police identified the bodies of the two fishermen with the help of family members. Kamalappans body was identified with the help of his initials tattooed on his hand. He is survived by his wife, Lakshmi, two sons and a daughter. He hailed from Vanavan Mahadevi. Somasundarams body was identified by his son S.

Sundararaj has said. Talking to newspersons after distributing welfare assistances to the members of Pudhu Vazhvu societies and Self Help Groups here on Saturday, he said applications from private companies are pouring in after Chief Minsiter J. Jayalalithaa had announced the establishment of the energy park at a cost of Rs. 920 crore. The Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Raasi Green Earth Energy in the presence of the Chief Minister, on Thursday for establishing the park, a first of its kind in the country. Mr Sundararaj, who hails from Paramakudi, said the Park, part of a pilot project for harnessing solar energy, would come up at Pambur in Paramakudi Taluk. He said the process for acquisition of 500 acres of land in the village has been completed and Labour Minister would soon lay the foundation stone for establishing the Park. The park would be completed in a year and would be ready for private entrepreneurs to set up their units, Mr Sundararaj said adding more private companies were evincing interest in setting up units in the Park as the District was best suited for harnessing solar energy, he said. TIDCO would create infrastructural facilities like drainage, water supply and roads at the site, he said. The park, the first to be implemented under the Solar Energy Policy 2012, would provide direct employment to 1,000 people and indirect employment to an equal number The Minister said the State Transport Corporations were also planning to set up solar power units to cater to their needs and sell the excess power to the Electricity Board. Earlier, distributing financial assistance to the tune of Rs.1.33 crore towards first instalment to the members of Pudhu Vazhvu societies, established in 53 panchayats in Kadaladi block for women empowerment and poverty reduction, the Minister said women should make use of the government schemes, aimed at improving their standard of living and developing the villages. He lamented that the Government had built public toilets, spending Rs.200 crore in various parts of the state for the benefit of women, but they remained locked in most of the places. If the toilets could not be used for want of water, the local women and those from Self Help Groups should take up the issue with the local Panchayat President and District Panchayat Chairman. Similarly, public libraries remained locked for months and years together in many areas and people simply do not bother. They should realize the toilets and libraries have been built for their benefits and with their tax money, he said. The Minister also distributed laptops at a cost of Rs 26.50 lakh and books for establishing learning centres.  OPEN",

        "content": " With political uncertainty looming large over the State, the Bharatiya Janata Party sounded the poll bugle on Saturday by announcing a three-phase campaign for the Assembly elections from January 20 and also declaring that it will face the polls under the leadership of Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar. The BJP has decided to use the services of its central leaders such as Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and veteran leader L.K. Advani extensively during the campaign. These decisions were taken after a daylong Chintan Baitak that comprised a brainstorming session of its prominent leaders, office-bearers and Ministers preceded by a meeting of its core committee. Briefing presspersons after the baitak, BJP State general secretary and MP Pralhad Joshi said the first phase of the poll campaign titled BJP: Door-to-Door would be carried out from January 20 to 27 during which the party workers would visit all the houses in their jurisdiction to make a personal appeal to voters to support the BJP. During the house visits, they would also deliver a handout listing the major achievements of the BJP government, infrastructure development works taken up in their areas and failures of the UPA government at the Centre. In the second phase, the party will galvanise its cadre by holding conventions of booth-level workers in each of the Assembly constituencies from January 28 to February 10, with a focus on polls. He said the party would intensify the campaign in the third phase, from January 28 to February 10 during which five teams headed by top leaders would take out poll yatras from five different places in the State and address poll conventions in all the 224 Assembly constituencies before culminating in a mega-convention in Bangalore. He said the party wanted the Bangalore convention to be a show of strength by ensuring the attendance of about five lakh people. Highlight The highlight of the third phase of the campaign is when central leaders such as Mr. Modi, Mr. Advani, Venkaiah Naidu, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Rajnath Singh will address conventions in about 50 places, he said. Mr. Joshi said though the partys State core committee had decided to face the elections under the leadership of Mr. Shettar, the decision had to be ratified by the BJP national parliamentary board, which is the supreme decision-making body of the party. Though the BJP has commenced its election work early, Mr. Joshi ruled out the possibility of the State facing an early election as being predicted by Karnataka Janata Paksha president B.S. Yeddyurappa. Elections will be held only after April 15, he maintained. Shunning deadline Ridiculing Mr. Yeddyurappa for issuing a January 15 deadline for deciding the fate of the Shettar government, he said: Mr. Yeddyurappa will keep on putting off his deadlines and issuing new deadlines till the elections are declared. He said the first list of candidates to be fielded by the party for the polls would be announced by the time of launching the first phase of the campaign. He said the meeting had suggested various issues and schemes to be included in the State Budget to be presented by Mr. Shettar.

        "content": " The story of the Internet began in an iconic year; the year when man took that one giant leap for mankind, musicians set the stage on fire at Woodstock, two hackers spent a summer developing the path-breaking UNIX operating system, and two engineers at a military research facility stumbled upon a way to make computers talk to each other. Though the engineers at the ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) made history by enabling exchange of data between two giant computers, via a 15-foot cable, it wasnt until January, 1983 that the possibility of a World Wide Web was born. A new protocol, the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), invented by hackers Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, paved the way for a network that could link many, many more than the 1,000-odd computers at ARPANET and made it possible for technologists of the future to envisage a stable and scalable Web of computers. The protocol, which went live on January 1, 1983, became the international standard on which the Internet was built. Of course, we still werent talking about the Internet as the mass medium it is today, for, it wasnt until at least a decade later that British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, or the Internet as we know it. 30 years Earlier this week, marking 30 years of the operable Internet, Cerf, who now goes by the title of Google Inc.s chief Internet evangelist  where his self-proclaimed job description is to protect and promote the Internet  wrote on Google blogs about his great adventure at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), where he co-engineered this crucial protocol. Back then, computers had learnt to communicate, but the problem that needed solving was the fact that all the packet switched networks existed, but in silos. This meant that with no common language, he explains in the blogpost titled Marking the birth of the modern-day Internet. Each network used its own communication protocol; to put it simply, each network spoke in its own unique language, using different standards or conventions. The only way around this was to develop a network-neutral method that allowed data to move between unrelated networks. As early as 1979, Kahn and Cerf published a paper on protocols for this kind of network intercommunication, something that they later split into two parts, TCP and Internet Protocols (IP). Over two years, 400 hosts of the ARPANET  the wide area network of the US DARPA  were migrated to the new protocol. About the gargantuan exercise, Cerf writes: There were no grand celebrations  I cant even find a photograph. The only visible mementos were the I survived the TCP/IP switchover pins proudly worn by those who went through the ordeal! In hindsight, he concedes, its obvious it was a momentous occasion: the day the operational Internet was born. Today, 40 years after they wrote their first paper on the protocol, published in IEEE, the proud parent recalls that though their hopes were high, they hardly imagined that they were laying the foundation for the worldwide platform its become. The early years following the switch to this new protocol were marred with technical traffic bottlenecks and congestion as more nodes got added to the network. Many scientists then contributed to ironing out these kinks, and stabilising the protocol, and then making it scalable. The India story Of course, the Internet arrived in India much later. In the late 80s, the academic country first experienced the network in the form of ERNET (Educational and Research Network), a communications project initiated by the Department of Electronics in 1986. It started with a simple dial-up network. This was restricted to the top public institutes  including the Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institute of Science, the National Centre for Software Technology and the Department of Electronics  all connected, in 1991, over a 9.6 kbits/sec lease line. Initially running on multiple protocols, the Indian Internet switched to TCP/IP in 1995. ERNET was followed by NIC-net that connected government departments and organisations, and later other Internet networks were set up by bodies such as the Software Technology Parks of India. The public Internet, as we know it, entered our homes (and non-academic networks) only in 1995 when VSNL set up six Internet gateways. This gateway Internet access service was first introduced in the four metros, and then extended to Bangalore and Pune. In the initial stages, growth was slow and the Internet, of course, was restricted to geeks. With the Internet speeds low for nearly a decade after, the Web picked up only in the 2000s after broadband was introduced. Private Internet service providers were allowed to enter the market only in 1997. Today, with 3G networks covering a substantial chunk of the country, and many cities seeing the launch of high-speed 4G LTE networks, the Internet scene appears to be a promising one. As of mid-2012, India had over 137 million users, much behind China, which had 538 million Internet users, and an Internet penetration of 38.3 per cent. As of 2012, Indias Internet penetration rate was a little over 10 per cent. The digital world in India has so far mirrored the real-world social divides that exist here. The Internet, despite these limitations, has indeed been a juggernaut. Much has been written about the socio-cultural impact the Internet has had on us; and the many facets of our lives, be it how we source our music, access reference material or interact with our friends. But all this is passe because the next decade will see changes that some believe will transform radically the way we interact with technology and will only deepen our ties with the digital world.

More than seven lakh students in the district will benefit from the scheme being implemented with the objective of strengthening the mental and physical health of students. Inaugurating the extension of the scheme at Government Girls Higher Secondary School here on Friday, Minister for Education P.K. Abdu Rabb said that the government was duty-bound to groom healthy children in the State. The School Health Programme was launched in 2009 under the banner of the NRHM as a joint initiative of the Health and Education Departments. As many as 1,327 schools will be covered in the new dispensation of the programme. Medical officers and select teachers supervised the programme implemented through specially trained junior public health nurses. The health data of 741,195 children studying in 1,327 schools in the district will be quantified in order to provide them suitable services under the programme. Topics such as adolescent education, ill effects of tobacco and other drugs, food, nutrition, and healthy lifestyle are being given thrust under the programme. Eradication of mosquitoes, strengthening of health clubs, holding medical camps, sanitation programmes and counselling, and referring students for special treatment are also part of the programme. Health officials said that the programme was being extended to all aided and government schools in the district by involving the 96 public health nurses appointed on contract and the field staff working under the Health Department. The Minister felicitated Keerthi Suresh and Abin Varghese, students of Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School, Kottakkal, who won the second prize in a State-level quiz competition conducted by NRHM.

        "content": " At a time when globalisation and foreign direct investment heat up public discussions and debates, a social satire staged by the students of Memunda Higher Secondary School stole the attention of theatre admirers on the concluding day of the Kozhikode Revenue District School Art Festival at Vadakara on Saturday. Made in China, a play staged by the students in the high school (HS) category, stated how new-generation consumers, crazy for Chinese products, sidelined native articles. The storyline of the play, which won A grade and a ticket to participate in the State-level school festival, develops imaginatively by showcasing the craze of a native king for Chinese products for adorning his palace. The king was earlier in love with native artefacts and curios, but suddenly his interest changed in favour of Chinese products. What we could effectively communicate to the audience was the gradual fall of that king and the ruin of his empire. The story could be equated with the present scenario where people are so obsessed with the foreign goods, unable to understand the value of our own products, said P.V. Amal and Gokul Das who acted in the play. They also claimed that their story could pass on a timely message to the audience. The costumes and stage setting of the play too pulled the crowd to the location. All the boys acted in the drama had artfully shaped kuduma which doubled the impact of their roles as the close aides of the king in the palace. A.S. Hari Vishnu, who played the role of the king, bagged the best actor award also for the same play. It was a 20-day meticulous training given by our director Sunil G. Vakkom that helped us to shine on stage, said Hari Vishnu. Several of the students who acted in the play were first-timers, he said.  OPEN",

Last year, about 30,000 seats were opened under RTE in Bangalore. First step The first step towards RTE enrolment began on Saturday with the deputy directors of Public Instruction (DDPIs) announcing the availability of seats in schools under their jurisdiction. As per RTE rules, every private unaided school is obliged to keep aside 25 per cent of its seats at the entry level (kindergarten or class 1) for admission to underprivileged children. In the next step, RTE application forms will be available from Monday at the block education offices. People can also download applications from the website of the Department of Public Instruction (www.schooleducation.kar.nic.in). For queries, call the RTE helpline on 1800-42534567. Poor response Enrolment under RTE was very poor in the city last year, with 4,276 seats filled out of 27,960 seats available (in Bangalore South and North).

He was speaking after inaugurating the golden jubilee programmes of the City Corporation here on Saturday. The monorail project has to be seen in the background of the massive traffic problem that the city currently faces. Steps to speed up the implementation of the project have been taken by the State government. The construction activities are set to start this year, Mr. Chandy said. Another major problem faced by the city, he said, was the scarcity of drinking water. The State government is not equipped to bear the entire financial burden of drinking water projects. We have requested the Union government to implement the second phase of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) projects. It is expected to happen during the 12th Plan period. Drinking water will be one of the thrust areas of the second phase, he said. Mr. Chandy promised all help from the State government for projects taken up by local self-governments.

East Godavari will become the first district in the country on Sunday to roll out schemes of both phase I (all pre and post matric scholarships) and Phase II covering all pensions and NREGS disbursements under National Social Assistance Programme. Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy and Union Minister for Rural Development Jairam Ramesh will launch the cash transfer scheme at Gollaprolu village in East Godavari on Sunday. The January 1 launch had to be postponed due to delay in linking the bank accounts to the Aadhaar cards. But thanks to crash work done in the last two weeks, the district now can roll out cash transfer to 90 per cent of scholarship beneficiaries and 95 per cent of pensioners and NREGS beneficiaries, official sources told The Hindu . East Godavari which had won Prime Ministers award for maximum Aadhaar enrolment could link bank accounts of majority of the beneficiaries to the Aadhaar number for the direct cash transfer. The district has 1,49,845 beneficiaries under scholarships and Janani Suraksha scheme and about 2.5 lakh pensioners and close to four lakh poor under the NREGS. The district could also include DCT phase II schemes - Pensions and NREGS ahead of other districts in the country because cash was already being deposited directly into the beneficiaries bank accounts. The disbursement was facilitated to the beneficiaries in rural areas at their doorstep through smart cards and the business correspondents of banks like FINO equipped with handheld devices linked to the banks. All that we did was to upgrade the existing process to Aadhaar by linking their bank accounts to Aadhaar number and it was done in 95 per cent of cases, they said. The direct cash transfer will start rolling out in four other districts - Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy, Chittoor and Anantapur from January 15. For in these districts, majority of beneficiaries have accounts in Andhra Bank and State Bank of Hyderabad which are in the process of moving to Aadhaar platform, an official said.

The often slow and knee-jerk reaction from police too is familiar. The latest instance of registration of cases against MIM legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi has indeed sparked a debate on the manner in which police in the Sate capital handled such instances on earlier occasions. Controversial statements by representatives of right-wing organisations and some MIM leaders during religious or public events in the city had been reported many a time. Old city being communally sensitive and the MIM having a stronghold there, police had apparently preferred to adopt a cautious approach in ensuring that their actions would not embarrass the political bosses in general and the MIM at the field level. It is these political calculations and the possible outcome of a police action that had weighed down police officers, and gradually an eco system was built up over a period of time. This comfort zone created in this eco system had gradually become so ossified that it would guide the first responder  the field level officer empowered to register a case  to ignore his basic duty and water down the response. Before registering a case - be it against a right wing leader or an MIM representative - the police have fallen into the habit of assessing the consequences it will have on the law and order situation. There is also no uniform practice or standard adopted by policemen in dealing with such cases. Officers got used to this so much so that they began to believe that this inaction was an effective tool to buy peace in old city or as an effective tool in maintaining peace in communally sensitive areas. There is no denying how we dealt with communal elements and those making hate speeches depended on the ruling partys political equations, police officials agree in private conversations. The Special Branch sleuths will certainly keep a tab on all religious and political events to get first-hand information about what is being spoken and how the crowds react. But only in a few instances their reports on the need to prosecute the persons making hate speeches were heeded to.   OPEN",

At a meeting to mark the 24{+t}{+h}Road Safety Week here on Saturday, he recalled that the practice was given up way back in 1998. He said Government was employee-friendly and contrary to what the Opposition alleged, had no privatisation plans and determined to bring RTC out of the red by improve services. The Minister and APSRTC Chairman, M. Satyanarayana Rao gave away awards for drivers with accident-free record. The three best drivers in the State are Md. Kaleemuddin of Greater Hyderabad (GH) Zone with 34 years, 6 months and 13 days of safe driving, M. Bikshapathi (GH-34 years, 5 months and 13 days) and S.A.

Mr. Khan said that keeping the recent incident of the rape of a 23 year-old on board a moving bus in New Delhi in mind, a proposal to provide train women employees of the corporation, specially conductors, in martial arts was being considered.

Alcohol consumption near the liquor shops has become so common nowadays that people tend to quicken their steps to cross the liquor shops in the hope of avoiding bumping into a drunkard, a possibility which could lead to an altercation. Problem for women Its not just a nuisance to road users alone, but a major problem for women and children who cross the liquor shops. For those picking up 90 ml or 180 ml whisky bottles and intending to gulp the liquor there itself, plastic glasses, water sachets and some namkeen are readily available. Either they are sold on push carts or by those hawkers who would just stand there with a bag containing the glasses and sachets. Win-win situation In most of the cases, liquor shops keep bottle openers handy for the needy customers who buy beer bottles. Buy a beer bottle, open it, carry it across, gulp it and move. Thats quick and a win-win situation for the guzzler as well as the seller. But such activity is leading to awkward scenes at many places. Nuisance near shops Many a time, the inebriated fortified with Dutch courage wobble onto the road as vehicles screech to a halt or they would make snide remarks at women or argue among themselves leading to fisticuffs. While shop owners maintain that they are not responsible for nuisance created outside the shop, police and excise officials say that owners have to take steps to avert such possibility. Andhra Pradesh Wine Dealers Association secretary D. Venkateswara Rao says the enforcement agencies have to prevent vendors from selling water sachets, glasses and snacks on the pavement at the shop instead of blaming owners. How can they expect us to contain the problem? Its not our responsibility once customers leave the shop on purchasing liquor, he argued. Excise officials, however, claim that they are taking action against the erring shops. Cases booked Cases have been booked against shopkeepers at Ameerpet, Secunderabad, Banjara Hills and Musheerabad, said Excise Deputy Commissioner M.M.A. Faruqui. Though it is not a rule, the department has made it mandatory for owners not to entertain such activity within 100 metres of the shop, he explained.

The dare comes from a director who gave us Aadi to Adurs, Chennakesava Reddy to Dil and Tagore to Badrinath. I agree one has literally seen them all, thus far - from the Swiss Alps to the Scottish Highlands, the British castles to Spanish beaches. But what I have canned in Slovenia of Central Europe, along the Adriatic Sea coast, is officially the first as far as Indian movies go, quips V.V. Vinayak. The director is giving finishing touches to Naayak, the latest Ram Charan-starrer with Kajal Agarwal and Amala Paul in the lead, lending more than glamour in this commercial entertainer that he swears will be clean, full of fights and a thick comedy track with Brahmi @ Brahmanandam as Jilebi! And oh! Yes, there is an item number with a charming Charmme too. Ask him about whats new about this approximately nine-month project (if one were to take only the shooting part) and the director says, It goes without saying that it will be different from my earlier films, but surely packaged as a commercial entertainer that viewers of different age groups will enjoy. As for the backdrop, it is yet another case of good vs evil and how the former triumphs in the end. So Naayak does appear to hold promise. For one thing it is the trio in the lead and for another it has S.S. Thaman with some fresh music in the six songs, in what is his first project working with Vinayak and Ram Charan. Others in the cast include Jayaprakash Reddy, M.S. Narayana, Raghu Babu, Dev Gill and Ashish Vidyarthi too, apart from Pradeep Rawat. All set for a Sankranthi release, Vinayak does not want to reveal much about his creation and is content just saying, I have an ace in this film that I will not reveal. Continue to prod him to talk about his experiences canning Naayak and he blinks twice before narrating how tough it was, working with a bone-chilling wind in zero, if not sub-zero temperatures in the Blue Lagoon of Iceland. It was encouraging to see the stars gritting their teeth and shivering, away from the camera and concealing their physical responses to the harsh cold as soon as I said ACTION and hearing the word, ROLLING, Vinayak smiles, signing off.

Importing products from outside has its own problems and this underlines the need to focus on R&D for developing mechanism to safeguard national security. Are we really engaged in R&D or are we primarily focussed on the revenue generation models of the products? he asked while inaugurating the Technology Day celebration of the IT & ITES Industry Association of Andhra Pradesh (ITsAP) here on Saturday. Mr. Narasimhan said the State continued to be a safe destination for IT investments come what may. The industry had stabilised its operations and there was no scope for flight of investments. Given new concepts like convergence and cloud technology, industry should consider their implication to the national security and what exactly we are doing to safeguard it. The country was confronted with multiple security issues like cloning and technologies like Google Maps that could help monitor the activities taking place in a particular location. Do we have capability to hide the Google Maps or technology that can ensure that events cannot be tracked by the Google? If not why dont we have? he questioned. This was where the contribution of the industry would be a great value to the country rather than revenue generation models that of course, is a bread and butter issue. The launch of services like Mee Seva mandated incorporation of security features for identification of users like a photograph to discourage unscrupulous elements misusing the facility. The industry, he said, could explore options to work with security agencies so that a defensive mechanism could be developed for ensuring facilitation of services to the common man. ITsAP president V. Rajanna said the State had the necessary potential for becoming leader in the IT sector and the association had submitted a 10-point road map in this direction to the Government. The sector was expected to witness growth of around 11 per cent during the current fiscal with mobility, social media, cloud and big data expected to become the major growth areas.  OPEN",

        "content": " Political parties in the State are gearing up to launch agitation against the Congress Governments decision to effect a steep hike in power tariff which they described a back-breaking burden on the common man. Already, parties are into an agitation mode demanding seven-hour supply to farm sector as it suffered losses on account of inadequate power supply in the kharif season. YSR Congress activists staged dharna on the Raichur-Mahbubnagar road disrupting traffic while Congress MP Ponnam Prabhakar led the protest in Karimnagar. The parties condemned power utilities for attempts to cover up their failure in taking measures to avert power crisis and instead proposing tariff hikes. Telugu Desam president N. Chandrababu Naidu, now on a padayatra in Warangal district, flayed the Government for not keeping its promise of providing seven-hour supply. TDPs Nellore district leaders staged a dharna at the busy Gandhi Bomma circle in protest against the proposed hike. CPI (M) activists burnt an effigy in Kadapa in protest against the proposed hike even as party State secretary B.V. Raghavulu said the tariff hikes proposed by the utilities were unparalleled in the country. The Kiran Kumar Reddy Government levied surcharge burden of Rs. 26,000 crore in the past two years and was planning to increase the tariff yet again. CPI State secretary K. Narayana alleged that the Government was encouraging private power producers in the name of merchant power policy at the expense of the State-owned utilities. This was evident from the fact that the Government had permitted the gas-based power plants to generate and sell power to industry charging an exorbitant Rs. 9 and above per unit. The APERC was playing into the hands of corporate companies who were into power generation, alleged senior TRS leader T. Harish Rao. The YSRC alleged that the Government, having mopped up significant revenue in the name of FSA, was now trying to impose another major burden.  OPEN",

        "content": " The modus operandi is old, but there are many who would fall for it. The gangsters scout for people suffering from a serious skin ailment or condition or baldness and claim that one of their relatives who suffered from the same was completely cured by an Ayurvedic doctor. The surreptitious referral of the doctor would invariably convince the prospective victim to pay a visit to the doctor, where he would literally be milked dry for a supposed Ayurvedic medicine. Adulterated medicine The medicine would apparently be nothing but coloured and scented water. This technique of luring people has been reported from several areas in the twin cities and ultimately the police managed to catch up with the tricksters. On Saturday, the Central Zone police announced that they had arrested a gang of 21 persons who used this trick repeatedly to cheat gullible people. While 19 of them were residents of Gokak village in Belgaum district Karnataka, two of their accomplices hailed from Hyderabad. According to the zonal DCP, Tarun Joshi, the gang members would spread out all over Hyderabad and scout for people suffering from leukoderma, baldness, psoriasis or even the visually and speech-impaired people. Glib talk They would strike a conversation with them to inform that their close relative or brother who suffered from a similar condition was completely cured by an Ayurvedic doctor. With their glib talk, they would convince them to try out the Ayurvedic medicine. They would initially give the contact number of the doctor to the victim, but invariably, they would ensure that the victim would request them to accompany them to the doctor. The gangsters would have rented a place in a posh locality where the victim would walk in. The doctor who would be equally glib would convince him that he could be cured and then the real drama would begin. Economic analysis Depending on the economic condition of the patient, the price of the medicine would vary. It could range from Rs. 4 lakh for medicines to be given for the three-month treatment period. Police investigations revealed that they prepare the faux medicine using coconut oil and colours used in muggu and sanjeera powder. They would use a few original reputed Ayurvedic products to gain the confidence of consumers. While they spend about Rs. 40 per kg, the medicine would be sold at a staggering rate of Rs. 100 to Rs. 3,000 per gram. Mr. Joshi said the gangsters had operated from Minerva Complex, Swapnalok Complex in Secunderabad, Maheshwari Chambers in Somajiguda, Raghavaratna Towers in Abids and at some other places in Himayatnagar. Generally, they would disappear within two months after collecting money from patients and shift their base to a different location. Items seized Authorities have seized Rs 6.71 lakh in cash, a car, six motorcycles, 15 cell phones and fake medicines from their possession. Sub-Inspectors G. Rajendar Goud, Nayeemuddin, B. Kantha Reddy of Abids station, Maqsood Ali of Narayanguda station, Inspectors G. Guru Raghavendra and Narsimha Reddy, ACP B. Limba Reddy and their staff worked out the case. The arrested have been remanded to judicial custody.

Hundreds of women from all walks of life gathered on the Tank Bund late on Saturday night, to say enough is enough, and claim their equal share of the night space. In the context of the Delhi rape and murder incident and the subsequent furore for womens safety across the country, womens groups, along with concerned citizens have come together and organised the Midnight March with the slogan Free the NightIt belongs to both Men and Women. The rally had participation from women of various ages, professions and cultures, who were unanimous in claiming their rights to safe and secure passage in public. The crowd, which was small around 10 p.m., swelled to about 1,000 to 1,500 in the next half an hour, and within no time women were seen holding placards and raising slogans breaking the nightly silence of the Tank Bund. Quit the silence. Protect Our Rights, read one placard, while another said, Ban the two-finger test in rape trials. Quite a few placards proclaimed death penalty was no solution for sexual violence. Shouts of we want justice rent the air. Men too participated in considerable numbers. Humanity, not Masculinity, read a placard held by male students. There is a lot of energy and enthusiasm in the participants. They all are here to make a statement that women need to be safe and be able to move around in night too without any threat. The turnout of this scale is quite wonderful, said Uma Indraganti, a participant. At the strike of 12 a.m., there was a surge of passion among women, who exulted shouting, We have won over the night. The march continued up to 1 a.m. and reached Tank Bund. The idea of a midnight march was the brain child of M.Tejaswini Madabhushi, a young professional, and taken forward by womens organisations such as Anveshi, Progressive Organisation of Women, Yugantar, and COVA, apart from many individuals. Social networking sites such as Facebook played a great role in bringing the women for the march.  OPEN",

He prefers the bulletin to other regional news channels, thanks to its local content and, more importantly, the medium. I make it a point to watch it to get information about local developments, particularly around Old City. Local issues Regional channels do not give adequate space to local issues and Old City-related events, says Mr. Kashif. Of late, several channels have come up in Old City, and they are getting encouraging response. These channels score big on prompt coverage of local developments. As a result, viewers prefer them to entertainment channels. Exclusive teams But how do they gather news? Many of the Old City-based channels have their own bureaus covering beats in every nook and cranny of the city. We have a team that covers every Assembly Constituency, and it reports all developments to the office, says Jaffer Balala, Managing Director, 4TV. This apart, a few channels have tie-ups with local videographers, who cover private functions, and freelancers, who work for more than one channel or subscribe to news agencies for video versions of programmes or incidents. Mohd. Akhtar, a Senior Reporter with Ruby channel, says more than freelancers and reporters, it is the viewers who help news bureaus to gather information about sudden developments. Sensitive matters  Most channels make it a point to cover every issue that has a bearing on the public. Such is the height of popularity that people first call up news channels before approaching police whenever something happens. There were a few instances when people informed about the illegal sale of ID liquor and prostitution dens in Old City to the news channels before alerting police. Residents inform us first expecting prompt action, admits a video journalist.  OPEN",

Women voters were seen in large numbers in many booths. Casting vote is our duty. Nobody can force us to vote for a particular party, said S. Shanta of Hokkadigoli in Belathangady taluk. Ms. Shanta was among 464 of the 1,393 voters who exercised their franchise at the polling booth in the Government High Primary School, Hokkadigoli.

Sunder Koraga (19) was elated at having exercised his right. I do not know much about the candidates, but I chose one of the two in the fray, he said. He had come along with his mother and sister to the booth at the Government Higher Primary School in Saviya in Belthangady taluk. It was not the same for some youngsters at Sornadu. Polling agents alleged that the officials did not allow some voters to exercise their franchise as their photographs were not in the voters' list. Complaints There were complaints regarding absence of names from the voters' list. Polling agents at a booth in Kutlur village alleged that names of voters from Panjal village were found missing from the voters' list. There was laxity in implementation of the code of conduct at many polling booths. Buntings and posters of the Virat Hindu Samajotsava to be held on January 2 in Mangalore were seen near many booths. At a few booths, people associated with the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party were seen bringing voters to in their vehicles.  OPEN",

        "content": " Elections to zilla and taluk panchayats in the district was marked by dull polling in the initial stages, which subsequently picked up momentum to shore up the voting percentage to approximately 65 to 70 per cent by the end of the day on Friday. Elections were held for 46 zilla panchayat constituencies and 171 taluk panchayat constituencies in the district. There were 13, 23,269 registered voters. Of them, 7, 74,772 voters were men and 6, 48,497 were women. The elections went off peacefully without any untoward incidents or election-related violence. But there was frustration writ large on the faces of many in Mysore taluk as their names were missing from the voters' list. Hence they were not eligible to exercise their franchise. The authorities were worried in the initial stages as there was lukewarm response from voters across the district. Though the voting commenced at 8 a.m., the percentage of votes polled was poor. At 11 a.m., the voting percentage in Mysore taluk was just 17.2 per cent while it was only 14 per cent at Periyapatna. Similarly, low polling was reported at K.R. Nagar (13 per cent); Hunsur (10 per cent); Nanjangud (15 per cent); and T. Narsipura (10.5 per cent). But the worst turnout was at H.D. Kote, which reported only 6.83 per cent till 11 a.m. By 1 p.m. there was an increase in the turnout. However, total voting percentage across the district did not cross 25 per cent and was pegged at 23.47 per cent. The voting percentage had not crossed the 50 per cent mark even at as late as 3 p.m. With only two hours left for the voting to close, the total percentage of votes polled was 41.25 per cent across the district. By 3 p.m., the voting percentage had crossed 55 per cent while voters continued to display apathy in Hunsur taluk where the turnout by 3 p.m. was only 29.49 per cent. However, officials pointed out that the voters' turnout had increased post noon. Though polling should have closed at 5 p.m., it continued beyond 6 p.m. to facilitate all the voters who had joined the queue before the closing hours at the polling booths. Officials expressed confidence that the final voting percentage could be around 65 to 70 per cent. There were tense moments at Hootagalli where names of more than 1,500 persons were missing from the voters list though they had registered themselves and exercised their franchise in the previous elections. However, it turned out to be a false alarm as their names were subsequently traced in another booth. In Varuna hobli, voting was delayed due to technical glitch and commenced late. It was common sight to see volunteers with dummy EVMs to educate the voters. Many couldn't exercise their franchise as their names were missing from the voters' list   Voting delayed In Varuna hobli due to technical glitch   OPEN",

        "content": " The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken up a detailed study on the impact of radiation from mobile phone towers and handsets on the health of the people. The study is significant in view of the growing apprehensions in the minds of the people on whether their exposure to the electromagnetic frequency radiation emitted from mobile phone towers and handsets caused certain ailments. The Ministry is hoping to come out with details at the earliest as medical professionals had taken up the study that will have a closer look on the effects of radiation on the ear (auditory system) and the brain. Disclosing this to The Hindu here on Wednesday, Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Dinesh Trivedi, who was on a private visit here, said the study is primarily aimed at collecting scientific data on the issue in the wake of the proliferation of mobile phone users in the country. He said that he had also asked experts at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, to throw more light on the issue following the concerns expressed over the effects of radiation from mobile phone towers and handsets. The Minister said that the study will be completed in the next six months and the Ministry would think of the steps to be taken based on the findings. On the basis of the study, the Ministry will sincerely look at addressing the issue in a scientific manner. I am sure there is a solution as the country has made strides in the area of science and technology, he said. Understanding the importance of the issue, the Ministry had decided to take up the study as the number of mobile phone users in India is growing at an enormous rate now. The rise in the number of mobile phone users has resulted in an increase in the number of mobile phone towers. Mr. Trivedi said: The world is going wireless and this will give rise to more magnetic fields and waves. Therefore, we should be equipped with scientific knowledge whether the constant exposure to radiation or the magnetic waves in any way affected human health. He said: We require scientific data to address the issue. We need to understand what the issue is all about with a detailed study. There have been some concerns about radiation, but we need to wait for the outcome of the study. Meanwhile, experts in the field of speech and hearing said some studies had been conducted in the past to examine the effects of radiation emitted by mobile phone towers and handsets on the ear and the auditory system. But the studies were by and large inconclusive. A comprehensive study taking all the factors involved into consideration was necessary, they said. There is a growing fear among people that it caused certain ailments   The Ministry is hoping that the details will come out soon  OPEN",

        "content": " Farm work first, and then voting! This was evident during the elections to taluk and zilla panchayat in Mandya district on Friday. The voting began on a dull note but the turnout in many polling booths went up substantially after 3 p.m. This sudden' rush of voters surprised the officers overseeing the elections. The increase in voter turnout after 3 p.m. was attributed to the peak harvest season. With most farmers and agricultural labourers busy at their fields harvesting paddy, sugarcane and other crops, polling at many booths, especially in the irrigated areas of the district, was dull. However, the voter numbers swelled considerably after 3 p.m., delaying the elections at nearly 20 places to facilitate them to exercise their franchise. There were similar reports from Mysore district. The pre-poll scenario in places in the old Mysore region was similar with farmers not talking much about the elections as they are fully occupied with the harvesting of crops. When The Hindu had spoken to some farmers who stayed away from electioneering, they had said they would cast their votes leaving aside the harvesting work for sometime as it was a Constitutional responsibility. Accordingly, many farmers and agricultural labourers worked till afternoon at their fields and later left for the respective polling booths. When contacted, Mandya Deputy Commissioner P.C. Jaffer said that the rush of voters at several polling booths was exceptionally high after 3 p.m. We came to know from the officers on election duty that voters were busy at the fields. After finishing work, they turned up to the booths to cast their votes. Most of them include male voters, he said. Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Jaffer said that polling went beyond 5 p.m. at nearly 20 places because of the rush. Additional polling staff and police personnel were sent to assist in completing the polling process. There were 100 to 150 people in the queue in some booths after 5 p.m. I am told that polling in those places was over at around 6 p.m. following additional measures taken to facilitate completion of voting, he said. Interestingly, the poll percentage shot up after 3 p.m. This trend was noticed in most places. Paddy, sugarcane, ragi, jowar and several other crops are harvested in the region during the period.

        "content": " The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) was taking steps to improve the quality of power by installing additional transformers wherever low voltage was reported, said R.Seetharaman, Chief Engineer, TANGEDCO, Tiruchi region. New sub-stations would be established in Puthanatham, the Navalpattu IT Park, Musiri, Valadi and Puthanampatti. The Thennur sub-station in the city would also be upgraded to as a 110 KV sub-station, he said speaking at a meeting organised by the Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu, here on Friday. This would not only help in improving the quality of power supplied to consumers but also in reducing transmission and distribution losses, he said. Responding to issues relating to the power shortage, raised by the council members, Mr.Seetharaman said the state government was taking necessary steps to tide over the shortage by purchasing power from other states. The situation would improve once some of the new power projects were commissioned gradually from next year. The State would become self-sufficient once the new power projects were operational over the next couple of years. On complaints with respect to difficulties in payment of bills, Mr.Seetharaman appealed to consumers to make use of the online payment facility introduced recently. Consumers could pay their bills through the website, www.tneb.in using credit/debit cards or net banking. Consumers were required to register themselves and choose a unique user name. On completion of registration, users can login for making payments online. A print of the e-receipt could also be generated. He also clarified that the facility of making advance payments was available for consumers. Besides, consumers from any place could pay their bills in the TANGEDCO counters anywhere across the state. Earlier, S.Pushpavanam, secretary, Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu, urged the TANGEDCO to make arrangements to enable consumers to pay their bills through banks and post offices. He also appealed to the Chief Engineer to ensure quality of power supplied. Mr.Shanmugam presided over the meeting. K.Venkataraman, Superintending Engineer, TANGEDCO, Tiruchi Metro Circle, was also present.  OPEN",

Mallikarjun Kharge has said that a draft Bill to amend the Mines Act, with stress on safety, health and welfare of workers in mines, is ready and it is expected to be tabled in Parliament during the budget session. Mr. Kharge was speaking after laying the foundation stone of the regional office of the Directorate of Mines Safety here on Saturday. Priority The Labour Ministry has decided to bring in suitable amendments to the Mines Act, according priority to safety, health and welfare of mine workers, especially keeping in view the Bhopal gas tragedy. Once passed, mine owners, including the top brass of multinational companies staying outside India, will not have any scope to evade responsibility or legal action, he said. Efforts Mr. Kharge, who dwelt on the efforts being put in by his Ministry towards announcing various schemes and releasing funds/grants for the welfare of workers, including those in the unorganised sector, regretted that Karnataka was among the few States that had not availed themselves of the full benefits of the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana for the unorganised sector. He pointed out that over Rs. 1,200 crore was available with the Construction Workers Welfare Board, which could be utilised for organising various vocational and skill development training programmes. He urged B.N. Bache Gowda, Labour Minister, who was present, to take advantage of Central welfare schemes and pass on the benefits to workers, particularly in the six districts that were part of the Hyderabad Karnataka region. He said that non-cooperation by employers was coming in the way of bringing in a suitable amendment to the Contract Labour (Abolition and Regulation) Act. We work in a tripartite system  government, management and workers  before coming out with a legislation. I hope that the Bill will be drafted and placed before Parliament soon, he said. Anil Lad, MP, urged Mr. Kharge to revive the hospital established by the Ministry of Labour for the benefit of mine-workers in Kariganur. Plight of mine workers J. Shantha, MP, while expressing concern over the plight of mine workers after the ban on mining, exhorted Mr. Kharge and Mr. Bache Gowda to initiate steps to ensure that mine workers were able to survive.

Despite the huge hype then, the seven cases met didnt even make it to trial as the Karnataka High Court, a full 17 years later in January 2012, discharged all the accused on the ground that there was no prima case made out against accused persons in respect of any one of the offences alleged. Poor labourers The Commercial Street police had then charged that four doctors  physicians, an anaesthetist and a surgeon  of a reputed hospital and a few middlemen had stolen the kidneys of poor labourers from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka on the pretext of treating them. They were charged under nine provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, the Court of Sessions itself in October 2005 had discharged them from the charges of causing grievous hurt, administering drug with the intent to cause hurt, robbery, falsification of accounts and for killing evidence, but had framed charges for criminal conspiracy, theft [of kidney], wrongful confinement, and criminal intimidation. However, the High Court discharged them saying that each patient was paid money and, as tests were conducted on them before the kidney was removed, had held that it cant be said that the patients were unaware of the nature of operation to establish that kidney was stolen from their body by administering drugs. Moreover, the High Court also found from the prosecution records that the patients had given their consent letter before surgery, and concluded that even if a trial was conducted it would a waste of time as all the accused could be acquitted in the light of these documents. But unlike in 1995, the police are now equipped with some well-defined penal provisions under Transplantation of Human Organs Act (THOA) 1994, which prescribes punishment up to seven years, including for indulging in commercial dealings in human organs, apart from the provisions of the Indian Penal Code. A former State Public Prosecutor pointed out that the Union Government enacted the THOA mid-1994, its provisions could not be employed then as the law was not notified for its implementation in Karnataka in 1995 when the police filed charge sheet. He, however, said it would be useful for the Ramanagaram police to study the 1995 case before filing the charge sheet in the present case as it would go a long way to help them avoid same errors and plugging possible loopholes.

Achuthanandan asserting that the attempt of the LDF government over the last 55 months has been to achieve growth with equity. Inaugurating the three-day meet, being organised by the AKG Centre for Research and Studies, Mr. Karat came down heavily on the Centre for what he termed its unilateral and arbitrary policies that placed heavy constraints on the State and cited the Indo-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement as one of the examples of the Centre's victimisation of Kerala. The agreement, signed without any consultation with the State government, posed both a direct and an indirect threat to commodities that are of vital interest to Kerala, he said. He also cited the increasing pressure on Kerala's public distribution system on account of targeting prescribed by the Centre, the neglect of Non-Resident Keralites (NRKs) who contributed around Rs.20 billion to the Indian economy every year and the impact of the hike in petro-product prices as major threats to the State arising from Central policies. Chairing the inaugural session, Mr. Achuthanandan said the attempt of the LDF over the last 55 months had been to prepare the State for a development surge. Launching a sharp attack on the last UDF government which, he said, had undermined the development initiatives of its predecessor LDF government, the attempt of the LDF, on the contrary, was to revive the productive sectors even as it strived for better distributive justice, Mr. Achuthanandan said.

After a bitter contest between pro-Islamist and secular groups for political space, reinforced by energetic and often violent street battles over the past three weeks, Mr. Morsy finally managed to hold the referendum on Saturday. The secularist opposition, which seemed initially inclined to boycott, decided to participate and reject the constitutional draft, which in its view did not guarantee equal gender and minority rights, and fell short of assuring freedom of expression. Just ahead of the poll, the National Salvation Front (NSF), the anti-Morsy coalition shifted its campaign from the streets to the media. On Friday, it ran half-page advertisements in newspapers rubbishing the document, drawn-up by a 100-member assembly dominated by Islamists, as a constitution that divides Egypt. The religious leadership of Coptic Christians  one of the largest minorities in Egypt  also endorsed participation in the referendum. Coptic Pope Tawadros II not only cast his ballot but urged all Egyptians to participate in the elections, regardless of their position on the constitutional draft. While no scientific exit poll has been conducted, Egyptian media reported that significant number of voters who had queued up seemed inclined to reject the draft.

Beyond consumption of 90 scm in four months, the rate applicable in these cities would also be Rs.26 per scm.   OPEN",

Kiran Kumar Reddy has his priorities chalked out for the New Year 2011 and is firm on taking his 100-day agenda' throughout the State for a visible impact on all fronts. Roadmap soon He will come out with a roadmap soon to make a positive difference in every aspect, from improving civic amenities in municipalities to ensuring all-round progress of State. In an informal interaction with the media persons who called on him to convey New Year greetings here on Saturday, Mr. Kiran expressed confidence that the 100-day mantra for result-oriented governance that began with Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, was bound to yield results. Next to follow is another 100-day programme that would focus on overall development of the State. We will speak to all departments, particularly investment and infrastructure, he said. Asked about the significance of Reliance ADAG Chairman Anil Ambani's meeting with him, he said quite a few other industrialists had met him and he was due to meet some more industry captains. Just watch out for the investments that will come to State in 100 days, was all he was willing to give away. To a question about Srikrishna Committee report to be made public after the all-party meeting in New Delhi on January 6, Mr. Kiran indicated that as Chief Minister he would have to attend the meeting convened by the Centre. Reiterating that law and order, welfare and development programmes would remain the focus areas, he said the government was thinking about imposing moratorium on private loans availed by farmers. However, the decision will be taken after careful consideration of all aspects and previous experience in 2004, he added. Kiran's take on finance On financial difficulties hampering allocation for capital expenditure and important projects, including Jalayagnam, he said financial problems were not unique to State. We should remember no State is implementing as many welfare programmes as A.P., he added. On more new schemes, Mr. Kiran said the State was first to launch Rajiv Awas Yojana in urban slums in GHMC on Saturday with an outlay of Rs.5,000 crore over next four years. Under the Central funded scheme, each beneficiary would get aid upto Rs.3 lakh for 370 sft dwelling. Responding to the chaotic traffic in twin cities, he promised significant improvement in coming weeks.    OPEN",

        "content": " The proposal for a privately promoted aerospace university near Devanahalli, which was first mooted at the Global Investors Meet (GIM) in June, is likely to fructify after the Bangalore Aero Show in February, sources in the Government as well industry told The Hindu on Saturday. V.P. Baligar, Principal Secretary, Commerce and Industries, said: The State Government is only a facilitator for the private initiative to establish a dedicated university for aerospace near Devanahalli, near the Bengaluru International Airport. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is also involved in the venture. The Vice-Chairman of the Karnataka State Council of the CII, S. Chandrasekhar, said that the dedicated university would train personnel working at all levels of the industry. The university will play a critical role in enabling Bangalore to function as a hub or a base for the aerospace industry, Mr. Chandrasekhar said. He said the university would provide training not only for research and development but also to those coming out of the industrial training institutes in the State. The Task Force on Aerospace, headed by Chief Secretary S.V. Ranganath, is closely monitoring the progress of the project, he added. He said a significant announcement may be made after the aero show in February. Mr. Baligar said the aerospace park near Devanahalli was in an advanced stage of completion. Asked about the progress of the projects that were proposed during the GIM, Mr. Baligar said: The progress has been really good, although things had slowed down somewhat because of panchayat elections in the State. Progress so far More than 180 projects, out of a total of 389 that were proposed by investors during the GIM, had taken off, Mr. Baligar said. Twelve projects have already commenced production. Twenty more are at an advanced stage of completion, and are likely come on stream in the next few months, Mr. Baligar said. Mr. Chandrasekhar, who is also managing director of Bhoruka Power Corporation Ltd., said the clutch of gas-based power projects proposed at the GIM were awaiting the laying of the gas pipeline by GAIL Ltd. The work on the pipeline is likely to be completed by 2012. However, the price at which gas would be supplied for the new power projects still remains a key imponderable. The LNG currently hovers at about $10 per million British Thermal Unit (mmbtu). At this price, power would cost about Rs. 5 to Rs. 6 per unit, which would be a viable proposition, Mr. Chandrasekhar said. However, the problem was that there were currently no long-term contracts for LNG imports, which could pose risks for power projects, he said. The task force was examining the possibility of instituting a canalising agency that could facilitate assured supplies of LNG at spot prices for projects in the State, he said.  OPEN",

        "content": " Even as the talks between India and Iran on working out a method of making payments for crude oil purchases remained inconclusive, India is working on a formula that will be acceptable to both and help resolve the crisis that threatens to hit oil supplies. Reserve Bank of India officials held talks with a delegation of the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran on Friday to break the deadlock, but the talks did not yield any solution. The public sector oil companies in India, the major importers of crude oil, have expressed concern at the RBI's decision not to allow the Tehran-headquartered Asian Clearing Unit (ACU) to be used for making payments to Iran. Petroleum Ministry officials said one of the options that emerged at a recent meeting in the Finance Ministry was that the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran would open an account with the RBI in India for the companies to make direct payments. The other was that India could write to the European Union (EU), seeking exemption from the certification process required for imports from Iran. It is felt that at a later date, the ACU could recognise a currency other than the dollar and the Euro. An Indian delegation would soon visit Tehran to work out the modalities for payment. The RBI said that the meeting between the two sides was a technical one to discuss modalities for future trade transactions, including in oil. Till October 2010, the transactions between the two countries were carried out in Euro through the ACU, which was set up in 1974. The clearinghouse settles trade transactions with Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, the Maldives, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Iran is India's second largest crude oil supplier, after Saudi Arabia, meeting more than 12 per cent of its needs. In the absence of a mutually acceptable payment mechanism, India may not be in a position to import 10 million barrels of crude oil from Iran next month. India imported 21.3 million tonnes from Iran in 2009-10; the imports are expected to be 18 million tonnes this year.

Karunanidhi said here on Saturday. Inaugurating the distribution of bags containing ingredients necessary for sweet pongal' free to holders of family cards and distribution of dhotis and saris to people below the poverty line at a function in Pallavaram near here, Mr. Karunanidhi said sections of the print media criticised the government for its policy of providing freebies to the poor. Pointing out that the print media did bring out free supplements, the Chief Minister said the criticism by the media was not about freebies but about the ruling party. The scheme of distribution of dhotis and saris, launched in 1990 during the previous DMK regime, was discontinued later. However, when the DMK came back to power, the scheme was revived. Explaining the importance of the scheme for the weaving community, the Chief Minister said the scheme provided employment to 11,000 handloom weavers of 217 handloom weavers' cooperative societies and 40,000 powerloom weavers of 121 powerloom weavers' cooperative societies. A total of 1.59 crore saris and 1.58 crore dhoties would be distributed this year, he added. Speaking on the occasion, Deputy Chief Minister M. K. Stalin said the State government implemented several welfare schemes for the benefit of poor and downtrodden. Among those who took part in the function were Ministers I.

With a proposed budget of Rs.5,000 crore, the project, Rajiv Awaas Yojna', will ensure pucca houses to the poor in every slum across the State. Announcing the scheme amid much fanfare during a surprise visit to a slum in the city's outskirts, the Chief Minister said the project will be completed over the next three to four years. First beneficiaries Dwellers of Banjara Colony, a squalid locality in Hayathnagar mandal of Rangareddy district, will be the first beneficiaries of Rajiv Awaas Yojna'. The Chief Minister sanctioned 380 houses on the spot. Your colony is the first colony under this scheme. This is the first step, Mr. Reddy told the gathering. We will soon roll out this scheme to other parts of the State. As the crowd cheered wildly, he interrupted, Do not celebrate just on the promise of a house. Complete your house construction fast and invite me to your house for biryani. This struck an instant chord with the locals. The State government has recently sent a proposal for Rs.5,000 crore to the Central government and is expecting Rs.1,000 crore to Rs.1,500 crore towards the first phase, he said. Guidelines Guidelines of the Central government scheme have been prepared by the Mission For Elimination Of Poverty In Municipal Areas (MEPMA). Addressing crowds from atop a mobile van, the Chief Minister said the Congress party has come to power owing to the support of SCs, STs and OBCs, and his party was returning the favour by celebrating New Year in their midst. He later cut a cake to celebrate the occasion and offered the first piece to a local boy. Home Minister P. Sabitha Indra Reddy, Marketing and Warehousing Minister M. Mukesh Goud, Labour and Employment Minister Danam Nagender, Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister Maheedhar Reddy and Handloom and Textiles Minister P.

        "content": " The Medical Council of India (MCI) has recommended major reforms in the undergraduate course in medicine by converting conventional education into a competency-based module to develop skilled doctors through early clinical exposure. It has also suggested doubling the intake of medical students to meet the healthcare needs of the country in the coming years. Distance education Pointing out that the current undergraduate curriculum in medicine did not make an MBBS degree holder feel equipped with adequate skills and competence to take care of the common problems at the secondary and tertiary level, the Undergraduate Education Working Group has said this factor also prevents young doctors from going to practice in the rural and primary health centres. The goal of training is not focused on providing health care to the needy and the disadvantaged, the eight-member working group has said in its report. It recommends options for distance education towards a fellowship or diploma in areas such as diabetic care, HIV medicine, geriatric medicine, hospital infection control, hospital management, and inclusion of medical ethics, forensic medicine and hospital infection control in the regular curriculum. According to the report, the current intake of medical colleges and the critical mass of doctors would have to be doubled if India had to achieve the world average doctor-population ratio of 1.5:1000 by 2031 as against the present 1:1700. Taking into consideration the existing medical colleges in the country, it was felt that the current intake of medical colleges and the critical mass of doctors should be doubled to achieve this target. At present, there are 330 medical colleges with an intake of approximately 35,000 and with the present intake the shortfall of doctors by 2031 is estimated at 9.54 lakh. To offset this, the report has suggested increasing the intake in the medical colleges wherever there is adequate infrastructure of teachers, equipment and clinical load and to augment infrastructure in relation to clinical load by attaching established medical colleges to district-level hospitals or secondary hospitals run by government agencies; upgrading existing larger district hospitals and augmenting their infrastructure to become community medical colleges through private-public partnership or public-private partnership and starting new medical colleges and hospitals preferably in States and underserved areas with doctors and medical colleges. Clinical training Chaired by George Mathew, Principal of the Christian Medical College, Vellore, the group stressed the need for restructuring the MBBS course with a four-year course and six months elective with a one-year internship. Clinical training should be included from the first year itself. The past curricular revisions have mostly added to the existing content without undertaking the exercise to remove what is obsolete and outdated. This exercise needs to be taken up in a detailed and extensive manner and make the curriculum as efficient as possible, the report has said. It has to be discipline-based curriculum and lack of integration between basic and laboratory science and clinical medicine should be addressed. It goes on to add that each medical college should be linked to the local health system, including Community Health Centres, taluka hospitals and primary health care centres that can be used as training base for medical students. The Working Group was set up in July last year to evolve a roadmap for medical education in India and to evolve a broad policy on the duration and curricular changes that could be adopted as future strategies to make medical education in India comparable to global standards.

        "content": " The primary aspect of concert acoustics is the microphone. Very often, veena artists are faced with the outcry, Why do you need a contact mike? It distorts the tone of the veena. For a veena concert to make an impact, the instrument should have the throw and power of a human voice. Whether in a closed auditorium or in open air, the music should basically reach out. Veena being a soft string instrument, a voice mike would make it sound feeble especially in a large concert hall. Even worse, the nuances that bring out the beauty of the instrument do not reach the audience in totality. This is the reason most veena artists resort to a contact mike. Choosing the right contact mike can be a difficult task since its technical specifications and placement on the surface of the  kudam' or inside the veena are the key factors that determine its compatibility with the instrument. Compatibility of a mike with the instrument can be defined in terms of the ability of the mike to amplify the true tone. With the advent of digital mike-mixer combinations, it is possible to increase the bass or treble content causing the veena to sound either like a bass guitar or a sitar. It is also possible to introduce distortion, leading to the lo-fi type of jarring electronic sound. These techniques can be used cleverly to alter the veena's tone. The need for conveyance of the true tone of the instrument is more of a personal prerogative and a question of artistic integrity. While the onus of good acoustics in a concert is on the contact mike, the final amplification provided in the concert hallalso bears considerable significance. In the older valve type of amplifiers, which only had a volume and tonal control, there was little room for dramatically changing the way the veena ultimately sounded although the amplification was feeble. Now that high performance processors are available, while very solid amplification is possible, the sound engineer might inadvertently tamper with the instrument's tonal quality by setting the wrong controls. Other contributing factors are the construction of the hall for minimisation of echo, maintenance of optimal temperature and illumination levels. Very often, the temperature in the hall is reduced, increasing the tension and hence, the pitch of the veena strings. In contrast to this, the high intensity lighting loosens the strings. Both of these factors do not cancel out each other but cause vacillating shrutis in the veena, making it possible to produce errant notes every now and then thus demanding extreme concentration. The choice of the right microphone for the veena brings out the vocal or gayaki style of presentation, in other words, the instrument gains the capacity to equal the power of a voice. In such a case, the popular notion that the accompanying percussionists (such as mridangam artists) need to subdue their performancein order to avoid drowning out the sound of the veena becomes antiquated. The accompanying artists are able to use the same vigour as in vocal concerts due to the enhancement of the tone of the veena with the help of the right type ofcontact mike. (E. Gayathri is a noted veena exponent)  OPEN",

A large number of school teachers handling primary classes participated in the protest which was organised by the district unit of Tamil Nadu Elementary School Teachers Federation. They demanded pay scales on a par with Central government. Another demand was to scrap the new Contributory Pension Scheme. The teachers also appealed to the State government to regularise the service of part-time teachers working on consolidated pay in elementary schools. Teacher Eligibility Test should not be the basis for recruitment of school teachers since they were appointed after passing examinations, the teachers said. While urging the government to conduct teacher transfer counselling in a transparent manner, which included declaring vacancies , the federation urged the government to fill vacancies in elementary schools across the State. They demanded further that secondary grade teachers from SC/ST communities who were working in elementary schools should be promoted as graduate-level teachers. The premium collected from teachers for the health insurance scheme must be reduced, they insisted. C. Sahadevan, former State president, Tamil Nadu Elementary School Teachers Federation, inaugurated the protest and addressed the teachers. R. Muthukumaran, district president, R. Chellapandian, district secretary, and D. Vijayaparthiban, general council member of All India Primary Teachers Federation, were among those who spoke.   OPEN",

        "content": " All India Agricultural Workers Union (AIAWU) on Saturday decided to undertake a series of agitations in the New Year to press for a piece of cultivable land for farm workers and a house site for the poor. Concluding a two-day workshop for AIAWU activists from seven districts, its national president Paturi Ramaiah said, We will not rest till each farm workers family is given at least one acre of land to lead a dignified life. Described the Right to Information Act as powerful tool, he exhorted the activists to invoke its provisions to identify and prepare a comprehensive list of land suitable for distribution to agriculture workers village-wise. He announced a two-month campaign from January for the purpose and prepare the landless poor for a long-drawn struggle to achieve the demand. We should act as facilitators and lead the struggling masses in various forms of stirs joining hands with like-minded political parties and other organisations, the former CPI(M) MLA said. The AIAWU chief gave a call for an Assembly chalo programme coinciding with the next budget session to bring the crucial land issue on the political agenda of all parties. He dubbed the land distribution mela conducted from time to time as a big farce. Under the much-publicised exercise, patta had been issued to those who were already in possession of land. It is just not enough if we plant red flags in select pieces of land as part of our struggle. We should continue our struggle till justice is ensured to the toiling masses, he told the cadre. Pressing for implementation of the Koneru Ranga Rao Committee report, he said the committee had ascertained that 68 lakh acres of land was available for distribution. He urged the State government to move the Supreme Court for vacation of the stay on distribution of tank bund lands, particularly in the delta regions, where such lands were no longer required for tanks after construction of irrigation projects. The government should give preference for small and marginal farmers in leasing out endowment department lands. Cancel orders Finding fault with the State government for giving away large tracts of land to big corporates on the pretext of industrial development, he pressed for cancellation of 26 controversial Government Orders during the then YSR regime, allegedly for accrual of quid pro quo benefits to Y.S.Jaganmohan Reddy. AIAWU Prakasam district secretary P Hanumantha Rao outlined the stirs taken up in the district in support of those affected by the VANPIC project. Maestro remembered The activists mourned the death of Sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar, who had composed ballets for the Indian People's Theatre Association, the mother organisation of the Praja Natya Mandali. AIAWU State president P Muralikrishna, State secretary V. Venkateswarulu, AIAWU district president K Anjaneyulu, secretary P.Hanumantha Rao were among those who were present. Over 150 delegates from the districts of Chittoor, Kadapa, Kurnool, Anantapur, Nellore, Prakasam and Guntur attended the workshop and prepared decentralised action plan to spearhead stirs. 68 lakh acres of land is available for distribution, says PaturiThe government should give preference to small and marginal farmers 68 lakh acres of land is available for distribution, says Paturi The government should give preference to small and marginal farmers  OPEN",

Chandrababu Naidu said that the proposed Money Transfer Scheme by the Congress government would only encourage corruption and remove subsidies to the beneficiaries. Launching the Vasthunna Meekosam padayatra from this interior village tucked away on the borders along the shores of river Godavari in Mallapur mandal on Saturday, Mr. Naidu said, I had planned to introduce the Money Transfer Scheme (MTS) to remove economic differences among the poorer sections. But, the Congress government-planned MTS was aimed at removing subsidies given to the poorer sections, he said. He said the Congress government had planned to remove subsidies to the poorer sections in the name of MTS by depositing some amount in the bank account of the beneficiaries of various schemes. He charged that the UPA government would provide fewer subsidies on various schemes such as fertilizers, foodgrains etc. and later remove all subsidies. Suggesting that the government should think about the existence of the Public Distribution System (PDS) before introducing MTS, he said there should not be corruption in the MTS and it should remove differences. Hailing the reforms launched by then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao for the development of the country, he said that the reforms launched by the TDP government in the State were being followed by Gujarat and Bihar. Not against separate Telangana Thanking people for according a warm welcome to him during his padayatra, he reiterated that he was not against a separate Telangana state, amid cheers from the gathering. Launching a scathing attack against TRS president K. Chandrashekar Rao for using the sentiment for his selfish gains to help his family members attain power, he flayed Mr. Rao for the neglect of various developmental issues in Telangana region. Ridiculing the UPA government for convening the all-party on Telangana issue, he reminded people that the government had not convened any meeting for the FDI Bill. He demanded that the Congress disclose its stand. Threatens to launch dharna Flaying the State government for failing to procure cotton from farmers by providing Minimum Support Price, he threatened to launch an agitation in Jammikunta town of Karimnagar district, demanding procurement of farmers produce. He also demanded an MSP of Rs. 5,000 for cotton and Rs. 10,000 for turmeric. TDP leaders Kadiam Srihari, Errabelli Dayakar Rao, Ch. Vijayaraman Rao, L. Ramana, Suddala Devaiah, G.

For her, it was quite an insecure setting where the most talented candidates were brought in to fight for the prestigious prize. As the curtain went up, Jaseela, with a yellow veil over her head, appeared quite confident on the stage. Her challenge was to recreate the true ambiance of a railway station which she had never seen in her life. But, the girl unflinchingly conquered the ears of the audience by creating an ambiance which most of them were familiar with. Only a few knew that she was visually challenged as most of them were glued to her astounding performance. Winning the State eligibility for mimicry was a dream for Jaseela, which came to fruition on Monday as the judges panel also pronounced their verdict in favour of this 15-year-old student. Warm hugs from her teachers and generous applauds from fellow contestants came in search of the winner proclaiming that she could stand out well in the crowd. Along with recreating the scenes of a railway station, Jaseela grabbed the instant response of the audience through imitating socio-cultural leaders and film stars. Actors Innocent and Prithviraj; music director Sarath; critic Sukumar Azhikode; and poet Sugathakumari were among the characters Jaseela imitated on the stage. I worked a lot to grasp the exact voice of the characters for the stage show. It was also a challenge for me to overcome the hurdle as a girl performer as mimicry was always a field dominated by boys, Jaseela said. She said the days ahead would be hectic as she wanted to learn more items for the State-level event. The girl who is deeply in love with the sound of children and their mothers said she would present an item on that theme at the State-level event. My attempt will be to simultaneously produce the lullaby and the mild crying of an infant on stage with maximum perfection, she said.  OPEN",

He was speaking at a function organised as part of the laying of foundation stone for a new building for the City Police Employees Co-operative Society here on Saturday. It was mandatory that 10 per cent of the police personnel should be women. However, the department was yet to achieve this target for various reasons. Now the government would give a serious thought to it, Mr. Radhakrishnan said. The announcement of the Minister comes close on the heels of the Centre asking State governments to increase the ratio of women police personnel to 33 per cent for creating an environment for women to visit police stations. However, women comprised less than 4 per cent in police departments in most States. The proposal to increase the number of women in forces was considered in the wake of the brutal gang rape of a 23-year-old paramedical student in a bus in New Delhi. However Mr. Radhakrishnan also raised the issue of police personnel coming under attack in the line of duty during demonstrations and protests, as well as targeting them individually. The government would bring in a new legislation for the protection of police personnel. The law would seek to punish the offenders with 10 years of imprisonment for attacking police personnel on duty. He said that the government had already issued an order providing jobs to over 300 relatives or dependents of police personnel who died in harness. Previously official formalities led to unwarranted delays in employment, Mr. Radhakrishnan said. The Home Minister said that police officers with criminal background would be shunted out of the department. Action had been taken against 13 police officers and departmental procedures had been initiated against another 133 personnel.

        "content": " The Supreme Court faced a stiff challenge in 2010 in dealing with allegations of corruption against judges of the higher judiciary. It took a bold decision not to elevate the then Karnataka High Court Chief Justice, P.D. Dinakaran (who is at present Chief Justice of Sikkim High Court), as a judge of the Supreme Court following a controversy over alleged land grab. Even as Justice Dinakaran was shifted out of the Karnataka High Court, Parliament initiated removal proceedings against him in respect of certain allegations and the probe is pending before a committee headed by Justice Aftab Alam, Judge of the Supreme Court, who succeeded Justice V.S. Sirpurkar, who resigned. The second removal proceedings against a judge ended with a panel headed by Justice B. Sudershan Reddy, Supreme Court Judge, recommending removal of Justice Soumitra Sen, Judge of the Calcutta High Court, for proven misconduct. Tamil Nadu quota case In a big relief to the Tamil Nadu government, the court granted protection for the continuance, for one more year, of the law that provides the Backward Classes, the Most Backward Classes and the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes 69 per cent reservation in jobs and education. It asked the State Backward Classes Commission to revisit the reservation issue on the basis of the quantifiable data in respect of the communities in question. If the Commission wanted to exceed the 50 per cent ceiling while re-fixing the quota, it could take into consideration the parameters laid down by the Supreme Court in the Mandal case judgment: compelling circumstances based on local conditions. To deal with the problem of foodgrains rotting in godowns, the Court asked the Centre to consider distributing them at very low cost or no cost as a short-term measure. When Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar confronted the court by saying that no order was passed but only a suggestion was made, the court again reiterated that is its direction on supply of rotting foodgrains was only an order and not a suggestion. The court referred to media reports on Mr. Pawar's statement and said, It was not a suggestion. It is there in our order. Efforts of the former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa, to get the disproportionate case against her and four others pending in a Bangalore court stayed on two occasions during the year did not fructify as the court was firm that the trial must proceed. However, the Supreme Court permitted the trial court to appoint an expert translator to assist in the trial. The court agreed to reopen the Bhopal gas tragedy case by admitting a curative petition filed by the Centre for restoration of the stringent charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which attracts the maximum punishment of 10-year jail term, against the accused. A trial court in Bhopal had convicted the accused to undergo two-year imprisonment. Subsequently, coinciding with the anniversary of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy, the Centre filed a curative petition seeking enhancement of the compensation of $470 million determined by the Supreme Court in 1989 on the ground that this settlement was arrived at on the basis of assumptions of truth unrelated to realities. Both the matters are still pending. While determining the question as to which parent the care and control of a child should be given, the paramount consideration remains the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under the statute, the court said. Relief to Mayawati In a big relief to the Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh, the Court held that the Noida park area would not come under the ambit of forest' and hence permitted the erection of statues and other structures in the park. The court decided to examine industrialist Ratan Tata's petition, which alleged that the publication of the tapes of his private conversations with corporate lobbyist Niira Radia had infringed his right to privacy. Mr. Tata has raised an important question relating to the interpretation of the Article 21 of the Constitution concerning right to life, which also includes the right to privacy. The court stood for press freedom and came to the rescue of the media. It was of the view that a whistle-blower who highlights irregularities of the government should not be silenced even if the speech or editorials appear to invite contempt of court and truth should ordinarily be allowed as defence. The court came to the rescue of the press and whistle-blowers when it said, If a speech or article, editorial contains something which appears to be contemptuous and this Court or the High Court is called upon to initiate proceedings under the Contempt of Court Act, the truth should ordinarily be allowed as a defence unless the court finds that it is only a camouflage to escape the consequences of deliberate or malicious attempt to scandalise the court or is an interference with the administration of justice. Issues under Right to Information Act It also decided to examine, by a Constitution Bench, the conflict between the right of citizens to obtain information under the Right to Information (RTI) Act and the right to immunity enjoyed by the judiciary not to disclose information pertaining to appointment of judges. The court said, The case raises important questions of Constitutional importance relating to the position of the CJI and the independence of the judiciary on the one hand, and on the other, the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression requiring interpretation by a larger Bench. In the Sethusamudram case, the court ruled out giving any direction relating to the project or vacating the stay on the project till the final report of the expert committee examining the feasibility of carrying it through Dhanuskodi instead of Rama Setu, submitted its report in February 2011. On the whole, the Supreme Court stood up to the expectations and reaffirmed the faith people continued to have in the judiciary when other institutions fail to perform their duty satisfactorily.

The Collector said that of the 37 victims, a solatium of Rs.2 lakh each had been given away to 32 families.

As per the government order the victims' families would be eligible to get the compensation only on production of the First Information Report from the police and the post-mortem report. The Chief Minister told the Collector that the latter could do away with such formalities and give the compensation to the families after getting the details from the jamath concerned and the respective Panchayat presidents (in case of the child victims).

        "content": " As many as 128 members of the Lok Sabha, forming nearly a fourth of the strength of the lower House, fall in the categories of industrialist/trader/businessperson/ builder. In the Rajya Sabha, MPs from these groups (25 out of 245) account for a more modest 10 per cent. However, in a potential conflict of interest, many of the MPs are also members of the Standing and other Parliamentary committees connected to their specific professions. These startling findings have been recorded by the National Social Watch (NSW)  a network of civil society organisations and communities  in its 2010 Citizens' Report on Governance and Development. The NSW said, while it did not intend to jump to conclusions on the basis of what it had discovered, there was a potential for conflict of interest in the situation which could not be underestimated. The NSW, which analysed the composition of both the Houses based on the professions indicated by the MPs, observed that over the past decade there had been an exponential growth in (the numbers of ) industrialists, businessmen and others from allied communities getting elected to the Lok Sabha as well as occupying the hallowed precincts of the Rajya Sabha. Citing news sources, the NSW report gave specific examples where a conflict of interest could arise. At least three members of the Standing Committee on Health run medical education institutes  Prabhakar B. Kore, from the Bharatiya Janata Party, M.A.M Ramaswamy, from the Janata Dal(S), and Datta Meghe, from the Congress. The 31-member Standing Committee on Finance is virtually a who's who of industry comprising, among others venture capitalist Rajeev Chandrasekhar(Independent), and industrialists Jaganmohan Reddy, Jawahar Darda, Sambasiva Rayapati and Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy, all from the Congress. Over a third of the Committee on Industry  9 out of 26  are from business and industry. The chairperson of the committee is Akhilesh Das, a BSP MP and a businessman from Uttar Pradesh. Industrialist Naveen Jindal and Andhra Pradesh-based contractor Kavuri Sambasiva Rao, both from the Congress, are members of the Public Accounts Committee. Notice issued The NSW noted that the committees on finance and industry were sought after. On one occasion, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee issued a notice to a few of its members, raising the issue of potential conflict of interest: He asked them why they should not be asked to withdraw from certain meetings, as the issue on the agenda was directly related to their business.

The resolution could not be carried as many of the councillors wanted precise details about the boundaries of the wards and the areas that would be demarcated during the expansion and the population of each wards. When the resolution was moved, Mayor M. Subramanian said Chennai was set to be expanded on the lines of other metropolitan cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. With the inclusion of 42 local bodies in the fringes, Chennai's boundary, which now is 173 sq. km. long, would be expanded to 430 sq.km. The number of wards would increase from 155 to 200 wards, taking into account the population in the municipalities and village panchayats. The Corporation had prepared projects, estimated to cost Rs.3,871 crore, to strengthen infrastructure in the suburban areas that are to be merged with the city. Most local bodies lack basic amenities such as sewerage network, water supply, roads and stormwater drains, he said. Zone 10 chairman M.Jayaraman said the existing Corporation limits must not be expanded. Instead, three more Corporations with Ambattur, Tambaram and Tiruvottiyur as headquarters could be created. Decentralisation of power would benefit the residents of the suburbs. If their areas are merged with the Chennai Corporation, they would be required to travel to the city to fulfil their demands. The number of elected representatives would also be reduced from 600 to 200. This would affect representation of civic problems.   OPEN",

While cardamom planters and silk cotton traders appealed to the Southern Railway to give top priority to their goods at Madurai railway stations, regular passengers, including government officials, students and traders have expressed grave concern over high bus fare. Worst affected The worst-affected were the students and office goers. Train fare was far lower than the bus fare. In the absence of train, all commuters had to depend solely on bus only. They had spent around Rs.235 per month for up and down train journey. But the bus fare to Madurai from Theni was Rs.24 per trip and to Madurai from Bodi around Rs.30. More buses sought They demanded that more buses should be operated to Theni and Bodi from Madurai and back during peak hours in the morning and in the evening for the convenience of commuters. Spice Traders Association secretary M. Shankar said that traders had made up their mind to bid a farewell to more than eight-decade-old train. But, the vacuum created by this passenger train would have much impact on the trade of cardamom and other agriculture produces. Now, we had to depend solely on road transport only. Our only appeal was to expedite the gauge conversion and complete it within the scheduled time, he added. Solace The only solace was that this train would come again to Theni with more facilities and gauge conversion would provide direct connectivity to upcountry. Optimistic They were optimistic that the Southern Railway would operate even an electric train. But we have to wait till 2013 to enjoy the service, said commuters. Guage conversion The Southern Railway would close the train traffic in Bodi-Madurai section from January 1, for gauge conversion of the track at an estimated cost of Rs.218 crore. This would be fourth one as three other works in Virudhunagar-Manamadurai, Dindigul-Pollachi and Shencottah-Punalur sections were under way. With no requirement of any major land acquisition, the Southern Railway had commenced ground work for construction of bridge across the Vaigai river. Five bridges had to be constructed.

        "content": " Here is a classical case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. The Madurai District Police contradicted the Madurai City Police while responding to an identical query made by an applicant under the Right to Information Act, 2005. T. Wins, a lawyer practising in the Madras High Court Bench here, had filed the two RTI applications to the Public Information Officers (PIO) at the office of the Madurai Superintendent of Police as well as the office of the Commissioner of Police, Madurai city. The applicant wanted to know the number of accused identified so far in criminal cases registered since 2009, the number of those who had been arrested, whether any of them had been detained under the Goondas Act, and the number of charge sheets filed in the last four years. While the Madurai district police provided the information sought , the city police refused to comply, claiming that such information was exempted from public disclosure under Section 8 of the RTI Act. R. Gandhi, an advocate, remarked that PIOs often give ingenious reasons for denying information. Therefore, it becomes necessary for the applicants tooutsmart the information providers. He pointed out that Section 8 of the Act lists out various grounds under which information could be denied. As per Section 8(1)(a), information could be denied if it prejudicially affected the sovereignty or integrity or security of the nation.. Similarly, Section 8(1)(b) prevents the disclosure of information prohibited by a court of law. But the PIO of the Madurai City police had conveniently failed to mention under which sub-clause of the section the information sought by Mr. Wins fits in. \"The only inference that we could make is that the figures could have been denied under Section 8(1)(h) which prohibits disclosure of information that would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders. \"Even if we assume that the information was denied under Section 8(1)(h), I do not understand how the disclosure of the number of accused arrested so far and the number of them detained under Goondas Act would hamper the investigation in their cases,\" the advocate pointed out. S. Sampath, an RTI activist, felt that it was necessary to ensure that PIOs disclosed information at the first instance without making the applicants undergo the hardship of filing appeals before the higher authorities and then to the information commissions.

Flagging off a Road Safety Week awareness rally, organised by the Transport Department in association with Voice Trust and Kalyani Honda here, the Minister advised the students to follow traffic rules and also spread this culture among elders. Accidents caused by violation of road rules resulted in more deaths than acts of violence. However, Mr. Raju said, statistics showed that the number of road accidents had come down in the last two years in Tamil Nadu, especially Madurai district. Such awareness programmes were conducted to make Madurai an accident-free district. The Collector, Anshul Mishra, assured that all steps would be taken to make the district accident-free. A cheque for Rs. 25 lakh was handed over to the Collector by L. Murali Krishnan of Kalyani Honda for creating a childrens traffic park in the city, according to an official press release. Mr. Raju also presented awards for drivers of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation for their accident-free record and to doctors who did not waste time in attending to accident victims. Murugesan of Voice Trust welcomed the gathering and Prathap Sethu proposed a vote of thanks. Contest for students Students studying ninth standard and Plus One bagged prizes in essay contest on road safety conducted in the city on Thursday as part of the Road Safety Weekcampaign, Transport Department officials and Madurai City Traffic police have been organising awareness programmes, and blood donation and eye screening camps. Five students of SBOA School, who participated in essay competitions, were selected for best presentation.

In the championship, as many as 650 athletes, including 100 women, from the States of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka and Union Territory of Puducherry participated. Organised under the aegis of the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu and the Tamil Nadu Master Athletics Association the event would have competitions in 100-metre, 400-metre and 1,500-metre dash, long jump, high jump, discus throw and javelin throw. The participants were in the age group of 30 to 85 years. S.P. Krishnamoorthy (85) told this correspondent that he made it a point to participate in all the athletics events meant for the veterans. Several gold and silver medals to his credit, having won them in national and international events, Mr. Krishnamoorthy had made it to the venue well in time. He said he would just watch the performance of the Tamil Nadu athletes and if the team fell short of points to win the laurels, he would jump into the fray. Seventy-year-old Prabhavathi from Karnataka, who is still an active athlete, found the hospitality in Tamil Nadu quite heart-warming. She had won a number of medals in the shotput event and had seen in the current event more opportunity to increase her pile of medals. Speaking on the occasion, Cuddalore MP K.S. Alagiri said that India had lot of potential to make its mark in the Asian Games, Commonwealth Games and in the Olympics. Yet, its achievements in these events had left much to be desired. The youths should take interest in sports and hone their skills to the international level. The master athletic championship should serve as the pointer for the youths to take to sports in large numbers and bring laurels to the country. District Sports Officer K. Thirumugham appealed to the MP to sanction funds for putting up a roof over the swimming pool in the stadium and also a synthetic basketball court. Accepting the demands in principle Mr. Alagiri, however, said that the new facilities to be created ought to be put to proper use and should not be kept idle for want of patronage.

Velmurugan has appealed to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to extend benefits of the special crop insurance scheme to farmers in the Kattumannarkoil and Thirumuttam blocks of Cuddalore district. In a representation to the Chief Minister, he said that owing to monsoon failure, denial of Cauvery water by the Karnataka government and power shortage which had affected tapping of groundwater, the prospects of samba crop in the delta region had become bleak. The situation had pushed farmers to the brink of economic crisis. Unable to tackle the situation, 13 farmers across the State had so far committed suicide. Having realised the plight of the farmers, the Chief Minister had come out with the special crop insurance scheme for the delta farmers. Following the announcement, farmers had submitted applications to officials of the respective districts in the delta region. However, officials in Cuddalore district had turned down the applications of farmers in Kattumannarkoil and Thirumuttam saying that these areas did not form part of the delta region. Such a denial had upset the farmers as they could not get any other means to redress their grievances. It was common knowledge that Kattumannarkoil and Chidambaram blocks were part of the delta region. These blocks were also known as the tail-end delta region. Mr. Velmurugan pointed out that not less than 37 villages in Kattumannarkoil and Thirumuttam were dependent on agriculture for livelihood. In Thirumuttam alone, paddy was being raised on 8,500 hectares, sugarcane on 1,900 ha and other crops on 2,500 ha. Therefore, to bail out these farmers, the Chief Minister should also bring them under the purview of the special crop insurance scheme, Mr. Velmurugan said.  OPEN",

Besides decline in volume of production, the size of cane too has decreased owing to various reasons. Farmers are wondering whether the crop would fetch them returns even to meet the production cost. The area under sugarcane cultivation has drastically come down. They attribute such a state of affairs to monsoon failure, dip in groundwater level and virtually no canal irrigation. Even if sub-surface water is available, it could not be tapped owing to power shortage. M. Jayalakshmi (42) of Appiampettai near here, belonging to a traditional farming community, told The Hindu that earlier she used to raise sugarcane on four acres of land. But, lack of rain had forced her to cut down the area and grow cane only on an acre. However, the crop did not flourish as enough water could not be obtained periodically. This had reduced the size of cane - in girth and height. The sugarcane stalk which would attain a height of 6 ft to 7 ft during normal season hardly measured 4.5 ft to 5 ft now. Its girth too shrunk and its juice content would also be much less. Ms. Jayalakshmi further said that even achieving such a minimal growth, she had to spend a lot on pesticides. For tapping groundwater, she had to spend Rs. 100 per hour on generator sets. Transport charges should also be taken into account while fixing the sale price in tune with the market demand.  OPEN",

A senior official said on Saturday that the government had approved a plan to send a pregnant woman as a \"spy or agent or decoy\" as part of a sting operation to nab offending scan centres. \"We can ask a pregnant woman to go for check-up in a scan centre and there she will tell them that she is under compulsion from family members to know the sex of the foetus. If they reveal the sex of the fetus, then we can swing into action. In fact, the government has allowed us to bear or reimburse the expenses incurred by the decoys for the scan test, food and travelling expenses,\" an official said. If the health vigilance wing received negative feedback about a scan centre, then the inspection team would take action as per provisions of the Act by catching the culprits red-handed. According to officials, focus will be on the scan centres in rural areas which are either independent or attached to hospitals, nursing homes and clinics. V. Radha Rani, Joint Director of Health Services, Madurai district, has said that the department would not hesitate to punish the guilty if it is proved that sex determination tests are being conducted. \"We are doing periodic inspections and only then the license is issued or renewed.Private scan centres have to send us monthly reports with details about the scan tests they have done. These days awareness of the Act has increased and scan centres know that revealing the sex of a foetus is a crime and invites severe punishment,\" she said.   OPEN",

Organised by the Traffic Wing of the City Police as part of 24th Road Safety Week, City Police Commissioner K.C. Mahali flagged off the motorcycle rally on Yercaud Main Road. It passed through Hasthampatti Roundtana, Sarada College Road, Five Road Junction, New Bus Stand and Four Road Junction, before culminating at District Collectorate. More than 300 participants, including members of the public, college students and police personnel, wore helmets and carried placards with messages such as Be Safe, Wear Helmet, Stay alive, dont drink and drive, and Avoid mobile phones while driving. They also created awareness about traffic rules among the people. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Mahali said that of the total 147 lives lost on city roads last year, 65 persons were motorcycle riders and pillion riders without helmets. This is 44 per cent of the total deaths on roads. Wearing helmet should not be seen as liability and riders should feel proud of wearing helmet while driving, he added. Pedestrian deaths Asked about steps taken to reduce pedestrian deaths on roads as 64 pedestrian deaths were reported in 2012, Mr. Mahali said that more zebra crossings would be installed in the city for facilitating pedestrians to cross roads safely. City police have registered a total of 24,380 cases for not wearing helmets and collected a fine of Rs. 24.48 lakh last year. Drive against those who do not wear helmets while driving will continue, he added. Deputy Commissioners of Police J. Ravindran (Crime and Traffic), A.G. Babu (Law and Order), Assistant Commissioner K. Radhakrishnan (Traffic) and police personnel were present.

The two-day conference saw expert medical practitioners and dieticians from across the globe sharing their ideas and knowledge on nutrition practice guidelines for Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Various topics including burden of diabetes on population health, maternal and child health, complications of diabetes, evidence-based medical nutrition therapy and behaviour modification, and the latest research on diabetes in India and worldwide were covered in the conference. The workshop provided the experts a platform to exchange ideas and share best practices related to diabetes prevention, intervention research and clinical practice guidelines, besides providing an ideal learning platform for international healthcare personnel to understand India-specific cultural factors such as Indian foods and typical meal patterns which influence diabetes. Speaking, Dr. K.M. Cherian, CEO and Founder of Frontier Lifeline Hospital said, Nutrition is an essential component of controlling diabetes. It is important that patients should follow the correct scientific diet pattern to manage diabetes. He expressed confidence that the conference will go a long way in exchanging the best practices between India and the U.S. Dr. Nirmala Jesudason, Consultant, Food and Nutrition Services, Frontier Lifeline Hospital, said, There is a vast difference in the practices between the two countries.

There are 25,843 ration card holders in Kotkasim district. However, bank accounts for the cash transfer have been opened only for 13,458 card holders  a little over 50%. Villagers asked to use their post office accounts, which were rejected as these accounts do not have online services. Other reasons for the less-than-enthusiastic response of people towards the pilot, as pointed out in the report, were: distance of banks from the villages, opening of accounts only in the name of head of the household among others. In the latter case, if the head of the household was infirm or was no more, accounts could not be opened. Ever since the pilot took off, barring January this year, there has been a continuous decline of sale of kerosene. A major cause of this was erratic transfer patterns. Several consumers, despite not buying kerosene, received double subsidy while there were others who in spite of buying kerosene for more than six months were deprived of the subsidy amount. Further, since there was no increase in the commission of FPS owners, they lost interest in selling kerosene and even ended up preventing sale of kerosene.  OPEN",

Participating at the farmers grievances redressal meeting held here on Friday, farmers expressed serious concern over the aggressive promotion of emu farming by a few private companies, which were collecting deposits from farmers and promising staggering returns. S. Thalapathi, a farmer from Kallipatti, said that a majority of the farmers in the district were not aware of the facts about emu farming and its profitability. Just because of the promise of higher returns and advertisements, many farmers are investing in this area. It is the responsibility of the Animal husbandry department to advise the farmers about emu farming. A full-fledged awareness programme should be launched to protect the interests of the farmers, he stressed. Farmers also pointed out a previous emu farming scam, reported in the district a few years ago, and urged the Animal husbandry department to take immediate steps to protect the interests of the farmers. District Revenue Officer Kumaravel Pandian instructed the Animal husbandry officials to conduct a study and submit a report to him within 15 days. Farmers also raised serious concern about the growing pollution levels in the Kalingarayan canal. Kalingarayan Pasana Sabhai President Velayudham alleged that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board was not taking any serious efforts to prevent the flow of untreated effluents from textile processing and tannery units into the canal. Instead, its officials were claiming that all the 310 units, which were coming under their control, were having effluent treatment plants and ensuring zero discharge'. But the fact is that almost all the units are letting out effluents in the Kalingarayan canal, the lifeline of thousands of farmers in the district, he charged.

Petitioner Anil Bhandari had challenged the addition of user charges in the electricity bill for the door-to-door waste collection scheme, recently introduced in Jodhpur by the municipal corporation in association with Ramky. The petitioners counsel Sunil Bhandari argued that these charges amount to violation of the Constitution. Besides, this [collection of waste] is the duty of the municipal corporation and by doing so the corporation is shirking from its duty, Mr. Bhandari argued. He claimed that the service has been introduced in about 15 wards of the city but the charges have been levied on consumers from all 65 wards of the city and even from the areas which do not fall in the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation.

According to a museum official, the second floor of the museum, which has been functioning in the exchange building of Fort St. George since 1948, would host an important nugget of Indian history  an 8x12 feet silk Indian National flag that was hoisted on the morning of 15 August, 1947, at Fort St. George. The gallery was supposed to come up by August 15 last year but lack of funds and bureaucratic hassles delayed it, said K. Moortheeswari, deputy superintending archaeologist, Chennai circle, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The textile conservation of the flag, which is in a delicate condition, will be undertaken by ASI experts. Apart from the flag, the original wooden flag mast and commemorative medals from the freedom struggle will be on display. Information on the history will also be provided, said Neeti Anilkumar, assistant archaeologist, Chennai circle, ASI. In May, last year, the museum had invited contributions to the gallery in the form of photographs, stamps, and letters, among other things, from the public and families of freedom fighters. However, there wasnt any response to the request, an ASI official said. We are still open to contributions. People can either donate or sell us the antiquities, said Ms. Moortheeswari. Ms. Neeti said a room adjacent to the gallery had been set aside to display such contributions.On any given day, there are at least 750 antiquities on display at the museum, she said. The museum is set to go digital soon. This will help visitors obtain additional information on how a portrait was made, for instance, and the technique used in the portrait gallery, said Ms. Moortheeswari.  OPEN",

        "content": " Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Saturday constituted a high-level committee under the chairmanship of Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam to study further relief to be provided to farmers in the Cauvery delta region. She also announced a Rs. 300-crore scheme to distribute Pongal gifts to 1.84 crore ration-card holders. The gift package, each costing Rs. 160, will include one kg raw rice, one kg jaggery and Rs. 100 for buying other ingredients for Pongal. This will ensure that people will happily celebrate the Pongal festival, she said. In a statement here, Ms. Jayalaithaa said she had already ordered relief to the extent of Rs. 13,692 per acre under crop insurance scheme and disaster relief fund. The high-level committee, she said, would study the drought situation and crop loss and make recommendations regarding taluks and unions that should be declared drought-hit areas. Relief should be given to farmers in due time based on the recommendation. My government will also ensure that farmers are not subjected to any difficulty and release relief in a fair manner, she said. She said the committee would include the Electricity Minister, Municipal Administration and Rural Development Minister, Housing Minister, Agriculture Minister, Co-operative Minister, Food Minister and Fisheries Minister. The Revenue Administration and Relief Commissioner will be the member secretary and secretaries of the departments concerned will be ex-officio members. The Chief Minister said in order to provide compensation to farmers who had lost livelihood and were facing unemployment, the government would undertake works for desilting water bodies to ensure effective water management to create large-scale employment under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. She said due to the failure of the North-East monsoon and Karnatakas refusal to release water as per the distress sharing formula, there was a delay in releasing water from Mettur dam and the water already released was also stopped. This has affected samba cultivated in the delta region and thaladi in the tail-end region, she said.

        "content": " It is not just peak hour commuter rush that amounts to the mad confusion in suburban railway stations. There is a fair amount of uncertainty among passengers when it comes to positioning themselves on the platform to board the train. Unaware if the approaching train is a 9-car or 12-car one, until it enters the station, commuters make a dash for the compartment of their choice at the last minute since coach positions vary on both rakes. The situation on the Chennai BeachTambaramChengalpattu sector is worse on Mondays when apart from the regular office crowd, there are large hordes of people returning to the city from weekend getaways. Close to 250 services are operated in this sector every day. Twelve-car rakes were introduced a few years ago to increase passenger-carrying capacity on the suburban network.  Since the 12-cars are operated alongside the 9-car rakes, confusion reigns supreme, said R. Prakash, a frequent train commuter to Egmore. Regular commuters like him say they have raised the issue at public grievance forums on several occasions in the past but to no avail. The issue might seem trivial to the occasional commuter, but is a pressing problem for those who use the service on a regular basis, said S. Anand, a resident of East Tambaram, who travels to Chetpet daily. A simple solution would be to announce over the public address system if the oncoming train is a 12-car or a 9-car one. Commuters can then wait at the appropriate spots to board the train, Mr. Anand said. In the past, efforts were made to install digital boards inside compartments so that names of approaching stations could be displayed for passengers benefit. According to Mr. Anand, digital display boards specifying the number of cars in the approaching train is the need of the hour at suburban stations.    OPEN",

        "content": " For over a year now, the biomethanation plant, an ambitious project to generate electricity from vegetable and fruit waste, in Koyambedu has not been functioning. In a bid to provide a new lease of life to the plant, the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and the Koyambedu market management committee (MMC) have now sought the assistance of the Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI) to provide a technical solution to operate the plant. Set up by CMDA in 2006, the plant was in operation until 2008. However, in the past four years, it has only functioned for four months in 2011, when Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited, the private firm that collects and disposes waste from the Koyambedu wholesale market, repaired it. The facility has been put to disuse because of the machine not working, and due to the poor quality of waste fed into it. Nearly Rs. 8 crore, including Rs. 1.75 crore spent by Ramky, had gone into its construction and operation. The plant has the capacity to convert 30 tonnes of waste into 2,500 units daily. Traders said the plant was one way to put accumulated garbage to better use, while also providing electricity to residents. With an integrated solid waste management plan for the city still on paper, garbage now continues to be dumped in Perungudi. Nearly 150 tonnes of garbage are generated daily in the market. CLRIs director A.B. Mandal, said their suggestions would include a change of equipment and ensuring good quality vegetable waste be fed into the plant. CLRI will also provide specifications about how to operate the plant. Waste must be collected in the morning to provide quality vegetable waste to the plant. A meeting with CMDA would be held in a few days and the plant would be operational in eight months if the guidelines were adhered to, he said. A Ramky source said they were unable to run the plant owing to a lack of space for source segregation and composting. However, the process of allotting one acre of land for source segregation, essential to the functioning of the plant, is now underway.  OPEN",

        "content": " The schedule for the classes X and XII board examinations for both the State board and CBSE is out. Amid unrealistic expectations, students have their noses deep in books, and schools are scrambling to give as many revisions as possible. While the State board examination for class X will be conducted between March 27 and April 12 with the first paper being Language I, the higher secondary examination will span out between March 1 and March 27. CBSE examination for class X will be conducted between March 2 and March 15, and for class XII between March 1 and April 9, according to the schedule on the CBSE website. The CBSE has asked schools to conduct the school-based examination for class X between 16 March and 31 March. The CBSE allows class X students to choose between the final written examinations conducted by the board and the schools. While question papers for both are provided by CBSE, corrections are carried out by the school for the school-based examination. While students and teachers are happy with the timing of the examination and papers, the race up to the examination will be gruelling for both teachers and students. Sequeira Sheila, who handles economics for class XII, said though she was able to complete her portions on time, teachers sometimes have to meet unrealistic deadlines. It is not always possible to conduct education in a meaningful way. With emphasis on revision, teaching time in many schools is considerably cut down, she said. Teachers spoke of facing great pressure to deliver 100 per cent results, and students of attending several special classes other than tuitions. M. Pradeish, a class XII State board student said that his school had finished portions as early as in September, and have only been revising since then. I go for tuitions for all my subjects because, in school, they are only concerned about finishing the portions. I understand the concepts only through my tuitions classes, said the MBBS aspirant. However, students said that the school education departments move to provide common question papers for quarterly and half-yearly examinations this year was a stress-buster. S. Meghna, a class X student, said, We got an idea of the difficulty level, and the nature of questions that would appear. For CBSE students like S. Poorvaja, who will be taking the class X board examination, CCE has considerably reduced the stress. However, with CBSE asking schools to conduct the school-based examination starting March 16, students opting for it will have additional time to prepare. Jashoda Sundar, who handles English for classes IX to XII in a CBSE school, said that though they aimed to finish the portions by January, conducting CCE activities is time-consuming. The schedule for the practical examinations for State board students is awaited. We will be announcing them shortly, but it will definitely be held prior to the written examinations, said an official from the directorate of government examinations.  OPEN",

        "content": " At least 1.75 lakh more farmers in the Cauvery delta have been brought under the net of insurance cover for their samba crop. During 2011-2012, around 3.5 lakh to 3.75 lakh farmers enrolled themselves with the authorities for crop insurance. For the current year, as per provisional figures, the number is 5.4 lakh. The increased coverage has been attributed to the State governments intensive drive to achieve universal coverage of farmers in the delta, which covers Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Tiruchi districts besides Chidambaram and Kattumannarkoil taluks of Cuddalore. Exactly a month ago (December 5), Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced a package of measures to the delta farmers including the governments decision to provide insurance cover to all farmers in the delta. As on that date, about 1.7 lakh farmers had gone in for crop insurance cover. When the deadline for insurance coverage was over on December 31, the figure was 5.4 lakh. Even this figure is provisional as some more proposals through banks have to reach the insurance authorities, says an official. Of the five districts, Thanjavur accounts for a maximum number of farmers covered with about 1.89 lakh. The figures for other districts are Tiruvarur  1.36 lakh; Nagagpattinam  1.16 lakh; Cuddalore  73,380 and Tiruchi  26,130. The achievement of such a large number was possible due to a combination of efforts by the Agriculture Department along with other agencies concerned including the district administration. As many as 1,217 facilitation centres were opened for enrolment of farmers for the insurance cover. The other significant aspect is the coverage of non-loanee farmers for crop insurance. As regards loanee farmers, it is mandatory that they take insurance cover. Of about 5.4 lakh farmers, non-loanee farmers account for 3.92 lakh. Towards universal coverage, the State government has remitted about Rs. 27.67 crore to the Agriculture Insurance Company of India. The per-acre sum insured had been kept at Rs. 8,692. Besides, under the State Disaster Relief Fund, compensation for paddy would hereafter be Rs. 5,000 per acre instead of the earlier Rs. 4,000 per acre to Rs. 5,000. Totally, the farmers, in the event of crop loss, would get Rs. 13,692 per acre. The insurance cover has been taken under the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme and its modified version.  For current year, total number is 5.4 lakhThanjavur accounts for maximum number For current year, total number is 5.4 lakh Thanjavur accounts for maximum number  OPEN",

        "content": "  When you turn a rather slim novel into a three-part movie franchise and let the first part unspool over almost three hours, you need to humanise characters that audience can feel for. Of course crazy budgets allow you to take care of every little technical detail and visual imagery but you have to pad up the content for no financial plan can ensure depth in writing! But how to make you relate to J.R.R. Tolkiens archetypical oddballs defined by big feet, bigger beards and faces that ugly cant describe. Belying all cynics, director Peter Jackson and his accomplished team manages to achieve all of it again in this prequel to The Lord of the Rings series. Though it is cut from the same cloth, it was more difficult this time for in LOTR there was a lot to say and you could hit the ground running. Here you have seasoned the characters and built up the conflict. At 48 frames per second, Jackson tries to make a fantasy a realistic experience. It is a debatable move but the end of the day it is not about the number of frames per second it is about willing suspension of disbelief. And as the master auteur turns just six chapters of a book into a three-hour-long adventure you do start feeling for the bizarre characters and creatures and their concerns. In the beginning it does seem as a picturesque case of much ado about nothing but as the film gathers pace and characters take shape, it doesnt turn out to be a lighter version of LOTR . Pushed by wizard Gandalf (Ian Mckellen has a way with bearded characters and here again he excels in shades of grey), hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) comes out of his hole and joins the 13 dwarves led by warrior Thorin (Richard Armitage is convincing) on a mission. The dwarves fervently want to reclaim their homeland which is usurped by a fiery dragon, Smaug, but the path is riddled with explosive puzzles with ferocious orcs and wily goblins eager to finish off the 13 plus. The orcs hunt for dwarves on the humungous wolves brings you to the edge and so does the attack of multiplying goblins on the wooden bridge. The 3D ensures that the speck of fire brushes past your nose and the enormous eagles make you fly. After a point, the action set pieces start falling into a pattern where it seems Gandalf let the dwarves indulge in compelling contests with adversaries and when things go wrong he comes in and shows his fire power. It takes away some of the unexpectedness from the journey. However, the riveting encounter between good old Gollum (Andy Serkis is outstanding behind the face created by motion capture technology) and Baggins turns the tide and the trip becomes truly exciting. Unlike other fairy tales, Jackson doesnt drop message-laced one-liners. He keeps the atmosphere light hearted with the dwarves game to make fun of themselves and Baggins not being sure of his prowess provides some tender moments. But it doesnt mean it is all flimsy as when Gandalf tells Baggins that courage is not just about taking a life it is also about knowing when to spare one, it rings a bell. In fact it becomes the underlying theme of the film where the homeless dwarves are aspiring to return to their home while Baggins reluctantly eschews the comforts of his hole to come out and faces the world. One wishes the ring of Gollum had more roles to play but Jackson is in no mood to show all his cards. Freeman conveys Baggins curiosity and bewilderment and we know Jackson keeps his hero in control because he has two more instalments to unleash him on the dragon but what he has done is enough to keep us anticipating for more.  In an industry where big is beautiful and long is laudable, short films get a step-motherly treatment. To tide over the duration trap, in the past the likes of Ram Gopal Varma and Sanjay Gupta have brought together directors to pool in their talent and create a collection of short films with a common theme. But Darna Mana Hai and Dus Kahaniyan are forgotten experiments today. Now Anurag Kashyap, the current deity of experimental cinema, breaks one plot into 12 different strands. He has plotted a mysterious death on the road and, together with Sudhir Mishra, selected 12 new directors to take the inquiry forward. 12 clues are found on the body of the unidentified person and each one points to a different city. As the investigation unravels we get to see vignettes of different cities and cultures and get immersed in the eccentricities of the characters, applaud the authenticity in the accents and ambience, but along the way we lose track of the primary task of solving the murder mystery and exasperation sets in as the independent voices try to bring too many things to the table. Anurag could have easily done it with eight cities but market pull spares nobody. The film is apparently targeted for 12.12.12 and art suffers in the process. From the pain of homosexuals to the effects of hacking and human trafficking, the directors touch too many points some with purpose, many for effect. As if somebody is ticking the issues to be incorporated in the project. However, amid all the effort to make the train of thought chug along smoothly to different destinations, some of the snapshots stay in the head effortlessly. Like the police officer in Lucknow trying to dip an oversized biscuit in a tea cup or that quirky man in Kolkata who collects high value ATM slips or for that matter that inspector whose bizarre talk about life and death, memory and smell sound funny till we get to know he is a case unto himself. The cast comprises mostly fresh faces but performances dont come in the way of the storyteller except for in Gwalior and Chennai part where it looks staged. The Lucknow chapter lingers on because of its inherent humour, the Kolkata story captures the crumbling city, the Ghaziabad story rivets with its original twist and a couple of stories manage to upset despite their apparent absurdities but the rest are works in progress. In terms of technique it is a bumpy ride because some of the strands are technically polished while in others you can sense the zeal to copy the men behind the project. And when it all finally comes together in the last act it leaves you underwhelmed. A feeling of Oh! No. Engaging in parts, it is laudable as a project but as a film, the act remains a put on.

During an interactive session with District Collector R.Palanisamy through video-conferencing held on Friday, the Chief Minister called for details of the flood relief measures taken in the district. The Collector said that of the 37 victims, a solatium of Rs.2 lakh each had been given away to 32 families. When the Chief Minister asked why in five cases the compensation was not given the Collector replied that while two of the victims belonged to the minority community that prohibited post-mortem, three others were children whose parents did not agree to the post-mortem. As per the government order the victims' families would be eligible to get the compensation only on production of the First Information Report from the police and the post-mortem report. The Chief Minister told the Collector that the latter could do away with such formalities and give away the compensation to the families after getting the details from the jamath concerned and the respective Panchayat presidents (in case of the child victims). The Collector said that the amount of Rs.309.79 lakh as compensation for crop damage was deposited with the District Central Cooperative Bank for further disbursement to the affected farmers through the respective primary agricultural cooperative banks. As for the delay in the disbursement of compensation of Rs.6.05 lakh to the affected fishermen, the Collector told the Chief Minister that the task would have to be carried out jointly by the officials of the Revenue and Fisheries Department. Since the revenue officials were busy preparing the list of damaged houses, there was delay in coordinating with their counterparts in the Fisheries Department. Cuddalore District Collector P.Seetharaman in his interaction with the Chief Minister said that irrigation crops were destroyed. The Chief Minister also enhanced the solatium to the victims of Jal cyclone.  OPEN",

It is not surprising as most of the existing ones are not maintained properly, have poor facilities and lack sports equipment. Yet, several councillors are demanding indoor stadiums in their wards. B.V. Ganesh, chairperson of Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike's (BBMP) Standing Committee for Education, said the panel has received several proposals for the construction of indoor stadiums. So many crores Indoor stadiums are being constructed at Nagapura at a cost of Rs. 5 crore and at Sanjaynagar at Rs. 4.5 crore. An indoor basketball court has been proposed in Kodandaramapura at Rs. 8 crore, Indiranagar at Rs. 13 crore and Rajarajeshwarinagar at Rs. 11.84 crore. The primary question is whether the stadiums are necessary. None of the city's indoor stadiums are maintained properly. The space is mostly used for exhibitions and conventions rather than any sports activities, he said. Other activities Mr. Ganesh said that most of BBMP's stadiums, including the hockey stadium in Akkithimmanahalli and football stadium in Ashoknagar, are used for various other activities. What is the use of investing so much in these stadiums and playgrounds when children in the locality are not allowed to use it? he asked. There are 154 playgrounds in the BBMP's core area itself. Crores are being spent on playgrounds too in the name of development'. The officials are unnecessarily constructing spectators' gallery in the playgrounds and roofing it. This is giving room to illegal activities. Instead of spending on spectators' galleries, a running/jogging track may instead be constructed. Then, the schools in the locality may use the facility, he added. Play equipment He said the BBMP would work towards creating better facilities in playgrounds by improving maintenance, providing sufficient lighting and earmarking a portion for children's play equipment such as slides and swings. The BBMP has no authority to direct private schools to use playgrounds and indoor stadiums. However, the 18,820 children of corporation schools will be able to use our facilities if we improve them, he said. CHITRA V. RAMANI  OPEN",

But the magical board of counting itself is modelled on one of the most profound of mathematical tools  the human mind. The frontiers mind could scale with mathematics unravelled before an audience of presspersons on Saturday, as two students from Kozhikode  Sneha Gireesh, Class III student from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, and Samjo Francis, Class VIII of St. Josephs Junior School  displayed how power of mind turned numbers into toys children played with. The power did not come to them easy; they sure had a taste for it but had to work on it, guided by the Mind Power Speed Mathematics Abacus Institute here. All their efforts paid off immensely, and they are now proud winners of the Higher C Level (Eighth Term) in the 18{+t}{+h}UCMAS (Universal Concept Mental Arithmetic System) International Abacus and Mental Arithmetic Competition held at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on December 9. While Sneha came first, and Samjo, second. Representing Kerala, they toppled the hopes of 5,000 students from 48 countries to get to the top. Both of them took part in the visual competition category where contenders were tested the speed and accuracy of calculation. The UCMAS International Abacus Mental Arithmetic Competition, conducted by Global UCMAS, test students in two categories  in visual competition and in listening skills where students are required to calculate mentally, with difficulty levels increasing as the rounds progress. At the competition, Sneha and Samjo were given 150- 200 arithmetic calculations to solve, including addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The training at the institute helped, and so did their earlier experience in similar competitions. Sneha had bagged the first place in the UCMAS All India Abacus Competition held in Chennai on August 25, while Samjo got a consolation prize. Padmini Varma, who trained the students at the institute, says the primary objective of UCMAS Abacus programme is to enhance the brain power of the children and remove the fear of mathematics by making calculations easier.

Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, Huchavvanahalli Manjunath, general secretary of the KRRS, said that the storage in the Bhadra reservoir was 47 tmcft of which 13.8 tmcft was live storage. About 6 tmcft of water had been reserved for drinking water purposes and 27 tmcft for irrigation in the CADA area. Earlier, the KRRS had urged the CADA to release water into the Bhadra canals for at least 120 days so that farmers in the tail-end region of the command area could cultivate summer crops. Farmers in the region were hit hard by the severe drought this year and their only hope was to cultivate summer crops. He demanded that the water be released from January 15. With more than 1.55 lakh hectares of land coming under the Bhadra command area, 27 tmcft might not be sufficient to meet the needs of the entire region, he said and questioned the propriety of reserving six tmcft water for drinking purposes. According to him, one tmcft would be sufficient to meet the drinking water needs for three months. Dharna The KRRS and Hasiru Sene would stage a dharna outside the Deputy Commissioners office here on December 17 urging the CADA to convene its meeting immediately and decide on the date for release of water into the Bhadra canals, he said.

        "content": " Vaishali R Venkat The very word Mathematics haunts the minds of a few and they feel it is a pain, there are a few others who are petrified at the sound of numbers. But for K. Jayaganesh, a Class X student of DAV Public School, Velachery, things are different. He humbly smiles at these statements and goes on to say, Do not be scary of Maths, for numbers are wonderful and fascinating. Jayaganesh says that he has an ardent love for crunching numbers, which helped him gain deeper thinking and clear concentration. He has spent years honing his mathematical skills to perfection. This IIT aspirant has shown keen enthusiasm in mathematics from when he was barely eight-years-old. His myriad certificates and prizes bear testimony to this. His father G. Kalyanasundaram says, Right from Class III, he showed interest in mathematics and was inclined towards understanding the concepts and its applications in solving problems. It seems that Jayaganeshs brains have muscles resembling the toned arms of a sinewy body builder. With his toned brains, even during his initial years of schooling, Jayaganesh had undergone eight levels of course in Brain GYM and Abacus. Abacus is a mental exercise, which helps children to improve concentration and stay focussed. Jayaganesh says, The course helped me calculate faster, without the use of paper and pen. I used to solve problems mentally. His mother K. Banu says that he is very confident and has earned speed as well as accuracy in solving problems. His interest in mathematics has helped him develop a liking for physics too, says his grandfather R. Gurumoorthy, who used to escort him for all his extra coaching classes, examinations and other competitions. I always prefer going with my grandfather, he would advise me on the ways of taking examinations, about how I should behave in the examination hall and so on, says Jayaganesh thankfully. Having gained knowledge in both the subjects, he has participated in various intra-school, inter-school and other Olympiad and talent search examinations and bagged several awards, certificates and cash prizes. Anyone stepping into his residence cannot avoid wondering at the shelf packed with his awards. Jayaganesh has been attending maths Olympiad exam from Class VII and had been successful too. He says, Maths Olympiad exams have a different approach from the school curriculum. The technique encourages students to think creatively. It enhances lateral thinking. Recently, Jayaganesh has been selected in Zonal Informatics Olympiad and was amongst the only three Class X students of Tamil Nadu. He is now preparing hard for National Informatics Olympiad. Besides, he is awaiting results of Regional Math Olympiad. Not with this. He stood amongst the top performers and has scored all-India-rank 119 in the FIITJEEs All India Talent Reward examination. For his performance, he has got 100% scholarship for the 2-year IIT coaching programme and has also won Rs.60,000/- cash award as scholarship. An avid chess player and Sudoku enthusiast, Jayaganesh says he owes all his credit to his coachers and mentors Sadagopan Rajesh (mathematics) and Balaji Sampath (physics). He also thanks his school principal, Ms. Minoo Agarwal, and other teachers for encouraging him in all his efforts and for supporting him in his ambition of entering IIT-Madras. Though my passion lies with maths and science, my hobby is to play keyboard, says Jayaganesh, while playing a tune on his instrument.  That Chennai has no dearth of young talents is proved for the umpteenth time  OPEN",
